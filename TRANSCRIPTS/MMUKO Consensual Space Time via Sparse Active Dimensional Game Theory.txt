Okay. Uh it should be recording now. Okay. Uh click the uh uh uh basically it should be recording now. One second guys. Uh yes uh it's recording. Uh uh everything is recording. Okay guys. So this video means a lot to me. Uh I don't want to write down any more than I did today. Uh but today uh this video is so important. I don't want anybody to judge me. But you know I feel um autistic ADHD asper just in I don't think it's because I believe my um uh um basically I'm going to basically I made my uh legislation uh yesterday. So that's my legislation for the OBS design and constitution uh OA which is public law uh uh public law uh public uh public what OA means public and you see it uh um and then the I J A G I J A G and uh I w that's the public uh related and protested a law constitution uh that protect the most people in society uh like people uh society anymore um with you anyway uh but this is very important with this okay basically I'm 24 years old I'm going to go to Nigeria uh but you know I'm going to rebirth myself as Mr. I believe I am here for a reason on earth, not for God. Don't believe in Jesus Christ. I'm a scientist. But I believe I uh you know I don't believe in Jesus. I never have Jesus. I don't care about Jesus. Um so OB go there. Uh I've got a diploma in computer science and a bachelor uh in what uh diploma in uh uh in uh I believe in business which I can't find. Yeah. I don't care. But you know my whole life focus ontology. Anthology just means um you you you me it's about me uh was looking at uh real world problems and how they affect you uh directly. Uh because that's what uh my all about. You know, I'm really building a constitutional model. But if you don't remember me, uh it's fine. You know, I want you to remember what I did for you guys. So, this is my watch. You see my watch here? You see like a It's never a diamond. This a Rolex. Uh first of all, my Rolex. My mom bought this Rolex when I was like uh uh uh 10 years old. 11 years old. Uh 10. No, I turned uh 10. 10. I was like a new but you know I believe in higher purpose and all higher purpose since my watch is a Rolex a fake one which is crap was new it wasn't like real basically my believe my mom my brother brought it mom didn't want to buy it she just she was my birthday 10 years old she didn't care for my birthday she give me a fake watch this fake was I told the time was working uh you know see the chains the chain chain are jingling you know uh but you know the chains are there this my like if you don't remember this watch and have this place to call a relic. So basically this is my first relic. Uh but you know a relic is just a thing I can hold. So basically when I get this much you know I can sell this watch and sto the time and basically I want to tell the time for you guys. So basically uh 2 to1 marketing you know this like athology. So for me my mom bought this watch and I uh my birthday 9 was in foster care uh 10 years my mom and she don't want to care for me. She says I promutistic EDG asper just learns ability of bipolar uh without but it just tes everything like sources uh later on but doesn't really matter uh everything in the book so I claim that money but no money is not for me it's for you guys so this every time I go out you know this watch falls down it breaks I'm stressed I'm stressed like so basically see the chains they are um they kind of old everything [ __ ] but see this one this like thing here. Uh it's like me present my relic. This is my first relic. Uh I still have it here, but you know I'm thinking of them has changed. So um this like me logo here. Uh see this watch is cracked. Can you see it's cracked? Take look. So it's cracked but you know it's not even working. It's not even take it you know and it's fake. It can't be fixed. So cuz won't take it cuz it's so old. Uh don't even take it and fix it and make it new. So this one saying I'm not broken. The system is so RAM is broken. So I want to take my relic and make it new. Uh so but I can mod this with my business but you know uh this is my first aura uh I sealed. So basically every time I take this watch I wear it inside out inside my like this my persona cuz I'm giving certain amount authentic. So basically it doesn't matter what it means. I'm not broken. Uh this is about time as well. So I put it like this. I'm going to wear this through my put like this. I guess I wear it inside inside out cuz you know it's too big but it's so broken. I don't fit into it. I'm not that big so I don't want to fit into it. So I just wear it inside out. I just if I try to go out right now what's the time? I'm late. I get time on my wrist. Why? Cuz you know it's a relic. It tells me the time but there's no time. The time has stopped. You know there's no time. Nothing moving on. You know we don't have anything new that can fix this watch. It's impossible to fix. You know, I'm building a new stuff. So basically, I can fix this watch myself and renew it. Uh because no one else will uh that's my initiatives uh next initiative. So uh you got the mit, you got the uh information that's from that's the first thing I want to tell you guys. Okay, next. So obviously I'm going to go back do my PhD. Uh but my P is going to last a minimum of three years. Uh life worth uh but you know I'm going to be doing that. I'm going to renewing I believe I don't believe in spiritual world. I believe in a purpose. I'm a scientist. I don't believe in God. I don't for purpose. So basically I believe like you know the purpose I have on earth and this is just to fix um the Nigerian economy but I now see the problem and the whole su I wasn't there to address it directly. So now it's my only chance to address it. I'm 24. So when I turn 24 I'm going to be uh right now I'm - 1 years old. I'm zero years old because I'm you know I haven't come 25 years but 25 years is my PhD 25 years is a new generation so comes out for me gen alpha of bfers gen alpha and beta uh but you know there already gers now uh let me go 25 uh 20 uh plus uh plus what 25 plus uh 25 years has passed so 2050 no basically when was I 2012. So 20 basically generation Z is a 20 basically. Oh sorry my going 2012 2012 plus that's the end of generation Z. So the go plus uh uh plus how many years plus 12 okay so basically to 5. So basically uh 20 2012 + 12 is 20 to the 4. 2012 2012 I don't really care about women guys you know for me this anthology I don't really care uh how my room is uh basically I want to push uh in beer I don't really care about anyone I don't know about this is a new gener you know I think going to suffer if I don't go there and I'm just renewing myself as them so basically uh my avatar is my spirit avatar is them I'm an avatar Mr. But you know I'm obviously I'm a grade but you know my name is Mr. That's my avatar. This is you diver inclusivity network you know that's my business model you live there you work there you breathe there you know you don't need to go anywhere else you know compu it's about stability uh civility I'm rebuild for me I have a computer science I have a diploma I still have a house in the UK I'm a council for me all I want but you know it affects me and affect my personal life you know I look a dirty bastard but you know I look a crazy man I'm not I'm very sane. I I know I'm very sane because this one thing I want to get rid of. Get rid of this thing. I'm trying to say people that are neurody divergent and neurotypical too has to be done guys. You know you guys are not the same. You never get along and so we know why you don't get along guys or how how you know cuz you know you guys are are two different uh kinds of people. Uh so basically uh this is my dragon. You see dragon. Uh now take a picture. If you want to take a picture we taking the picture now. Three two one. This is it guys. This is my uh dragon. Sorry, this is my a bird. This is not a bird. I say this is just like uh what do you call it? Uh my life. So this is like I'm the turtle. I can move slow but I have wings and the wings are flying. So basically uh the muk turtles are the spirit of what you uh the spirit of good and evil. And the zygote is just something that's a child man or woman like you know something that's you got like a a young cat uh a baby cat being born. uh mam something mam has not been born a whale has not been born because that's more scientific than they have carried the wound so we are mammals but we are zygot of m eggs can be m but the chicken egg so that's unborn chicken zy of the chicken so that's what it is so but see this one this one this one is born so that was me I was perfect I could do everything myself but you know I had wings but I was wingless you know I was just walking walking slowly so this is what I want to give you guys so you can do everything yourself perfect but you know you uh wingless, you know. So, I had the wings, but you don't have the wings no more. You can fly like me as a child, you know. You know, that's what I'm saying. I'm going to put the wings wing in the wingless, the the hope in the hopeless and the and the and the voice in the voiceless. Uh you know, cuz I believe in higher purpose uh uh and a higher calling uh than killing people. Uh ontology, the nature of being. Uh so, basically, I'm just introduce um I'm going to go there, but I'm going to calling with you guys literally teaching to you how to crawl. I'm learning some children how to crawl. Uh that's my friends that I missed with the children. So basically my children basically they're going to have um they to crawl uh be crawling uh with me uh children to walk cuz you know if they teach me to crawl I learn to crawl properly and teach me to walk. I learn to walk to talk. So to see how they learn because you know that's more about my people. I don't really care about YouTube. I don't [ __ ] know nothing about see this um thing. You got like a 2D spots. Basically uh if I don't say I'll never say it. Uh so basically um my brain uh basically if you have a 3D uh sparse matrix um anything if you're fully in a 3D reality you are what uh using a 3x3 matrix. So you have the same problem for 2D matrix I have to prove it now because you know I just think that I have to prove it you know. So I have to do it properly. If I never do this I will never do this again. And I don't I only want to do it once. You got to try it yourself. I don't want to be doing again. So, so I'm trying to do it here. So, so you know 3x3 matrix 3 * 3 you get six uh six 9 sorry 9. But if you do 3 + 3 you get uh six six. So what this means you get like six minimum dimensions 3x3 or what? 3x 3 n dimensions. So 6 + 9 is what? Uh 15 dimensions of what? Uh dimensions uh that's pass. Now that's pass relationship is not fully that's the world you live in. But that could be mapped to a 2D world. So basically that 3D eyes can be 2D 2D 2D perception. Uh but you know that's the do now. If I don't do it now you guys never get it. So you know 3D uh that mean 15 dimensions you get uh in the real world you know in the real world uh you know just uh because you know you got three minimum 15 15 maximum so you're going to just say 15 maximum but you go to remove your move this bally 3D or it's just why I don't control 15 dimension only call control my dimension 3D that's there but it's 15 dimensions maximum if there is theoretical uh and then what I'm saying to you is this you If I want to perceive the real world I have my own dimension my mind but my mind is 7 * 7 basically I get like seven dimension uh 7 union 7 union 7 maximum so that's 7 unit 7 * 7 is what 7 + 7 is what uh 14 now 14 7 * 7 is 49 and that give me 63 uh things I can control based on my sensory eyes nose mouth but you know there are six senses what I observe what I control what I observe, you know, I can interpret while interpretation layer uh the GSI files, you know, uh gossip uh gossip uh gossip programming language uh interpretation files, you know, for poly systems and then the GS files, the gossip language, you know, uh basically the interpretation is for policies interpretation and full system cover, Python, C, Rust, etc. You can have that, you know, if you're not important policies in um the GS GSI files, you're really [ __ ] up system for yourself. Uh now uh now uh 49 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 13 13 now four five six. So basically goes into three dimensions you can act on uh bas. So CC is a uh so basically this three world this uh 16 dimensions just what normal neurotypical normal people have normal uh neurotypical people have people not just like you know awkward you know but I'm extruding ordinary so I'm going to try to prove that uh now so we got 62 dimensions and now we got uh 7 * 7 so we got 49 we got 63 dimensions you know uh just the minimum the minimum uh life work breath uh segment so you live you have to be have to work and breathe in a dimension you have to have like a century in this kind of 3D world uh which is what uh 16 to 3 What? 15D the 3 to 15D uh 15D method. I'm using protected for another plane a 4D plane. Uh I'm just going to try to frame myself only and end this video. Uh before I continue this video done a long time ago. Uh so uh minimum minimum 16 uh to 16 union uh 15D 15D uh where D is a dimension of the unity uh union and district for the neural brain brain because you know uh you know that's is sensory uh sensor you have um 63 human rights uh by default in condition you know minimum who can finally take this past you if you can even get the minimum that they kind of kill you killing your ability to do Okay. Uh but you know your 15 dimensions is just uh for not 13 15 dimensions quantum field that's my model. We got 15 dimensions in quantum field. So we have to explore all the dimensions with all our sensors you know uh based on what we can control and we can't control uh for quantum field theory. Uh but you know my so that's basically five to seven uh for the worst neutral people that's five uh can only observe five dimensions. dimension they can't really see anything take anything in if they don't have the dimension scene the blind seven they can't really take in seven that mean can't really whatever they saw uh which is duality there you know I'm talking about that myself only so I believe I am uh in the dimension of 17 to 14 uh I'm so sensually I believe I'm like you know if a double 7 plus 7 is what uh 14 so I can control all my dimensions I have like a a strong of my mind. I can see what what could see uh if they let me in, you know, but I need consensus, you know, uh my cons. So uh so you got like 14 uh * 14 uh which is the maximum senses. So 14 + 14 uh so calculator uh 14 * 14 try to do 14 uh equal to 196. Now 14 + 14 is equal to 28. So that's supposed to broke uh doesn't mean broke. I wish I broke the box. Even though you diver people, that's my but don't care. Basically, I'm no I feel I call myself new flexible. I'm so flexible. I'm not divergent. I'm just myself existence, you know. Uh so we got 6 8 + 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14. Now we get uh 44 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 and then 20 224 dimension uh units. I have the dimension to the four I can control to 63 because I believe my mind is four dimensional. So I'm aware of my state and state who I am where I'm from. So basically my mind is 40. So I believe I'm being projected to 3D world for a reason for purpose to your world. Uh but you know it's just my proof you know I'm so I can see stuff people don't see easily. I can pick up stuff that people don't know of and uh but you know I use my mind to do that. uh what's my problem of mind control basically my mind of a matter product you know if I have all control of the mind I lose all control of the body but you know that's what I'm saying it's just like that you know so you don't want to die so it's just like the mind you know you know mind state of the body you know sobody all the consciousness you know that means they're dead or alive and they're being polarized So uh one more thing guys here to um this is my thing of riches fix Nigeria constitution have a life but you know if you see in dimension you know one day you see me oh this is uh you know I'm busy dimension four dimensions the four dimension which the higher plane but the high plane is not the goal here me going back to that plane is not the goal uh the goal here for me oh time Okay, let me not end this now. Let me end at 30 because I said the time for me to show try to make you know bring up a new flexibility people myself as a child myself. I'm trying to figure out how this why people are keep them. Uh they have five they can do their own things. I don't really care. I want the best life ever because if I ever stay in that dimension uh I want to return to my constitution what I do you know why I made for the people that actually care so I I know uh I know I return to not to Mar but to the soul and the soil bly not the soul not the source like you know the sand the place from returning the which is of from which is from the heart so basically I'm going to give you back twice double you know from the I give you one. That's what I have for you. I'm going to give you two. That means I have double. Don't give you guys uh two uh tological sovereignty concentry and we walk with you. I will learn to walk with you guys uh your children but you know um heal us all change. I I there's no consent. You have consensus in the world. You uh basically the consent is I don't like it. I consent. So if I consent to something and you say no. Uh do you say I don't consent to it? You know it's just too rigid. So do you consent to me using your phone number? No. Uh do you consent to me using your phone? Yes. Uh oh that's fine. So basically uh I've now per said yes once. So um the consent uh is just wrong. Consent once forever. Uh so that's wrong. So that's consent done. So no consent to my phone consensus. Now consensus means what you get. Do you consent to using your phone? Uh yes. Do you consent to me using your phone? No. Do you consent to me using your phone? Yes. So two yes. Yes. Are you using your phone? One. Yes. I'm not sure. So that's a paradox there. Uh consensus paradox. I never consider using my phone unless they are um uh know what they're doing on my phone. I can't view my uh uh bank account inside my data when I use for life. I didn't want to touch my phone even uh one more thing journey to face. So I I'm going to do my schedule B this year. Uh I'm going to do uh J basically basically let me just try with the work guys. No no no this work. No, no, no. This work one. Sorry. Sorry, guys. I'm thinking of the work one here. It's very dirty, guys. I look dirty, man. I'm not so 14 to 2 to1 ratio. Uh 14 human rights seven. So, basically going to have the maximum of expression and that includes your uh your standard human rights seven * 7 or 7. That's just like your shout out uh for living. Uh living just uh basically you're going to have like a 2 to one mark. So you get like a 2 to1 mapping. So if I have a 17 to 14 to 7, that's like two human rights. So one, but I can live and breathe. I can live and breathe. But I cannot work. So if I want to work my my after 28 uh like 7 plus 21 to uh 7 uh so I can work a little bit uh not optional. Uh if I want to work as optional to work to work, but I want to opt into work. uh uh that's 247 to to 7 which is a 3 to1 ratio human right uh thing you know I don't anyone working in the position I want you guys to enjoy life uh so not for the population because you know I want to join with you guys too uh the culture things I missed when I was in UK maybe have a girlfriend I don't mind so here basically this is me Is there any thinner forly? Uh yes, you see this is not the one I brought the wing one. So basically I am not broken system is so I have wings as a child which system never let me use my wings. Uh so basically the wings are uh this is a butterfly a dual mock. So if you can interally beauty this could be a butterfly or water turtles. Uh but turtus just flies on the has wings when they want to fly. Uh the butterflies on the battlefield. So if once fly do I have a turtus and the turtles will be able to fly because two ones you can be um flexible uh like me flexible flexible uh the world divergent is banned so uh before I continue I'm going to ban so basically these are a lot of things happen in the world I'm basing the entire UK economy from my constitutional model um you know because you know they can can build their own they can build their own constitution uh but you know the the pattern spike in four years. Uh that's 22,43 because they indirectly supporting um just me 2073. Uh it's just because it's four years 25 plus 24 is what uh 73 years uh US Brazil 73 because you know Brazil you know the slave choice. So you go from uh British to B of B of Benin and the B of Bin will be uh south the coast of the coastal areas uh where you can get away with this easily and from coastal ed basically it works for them because it's just so rigid you know fixing their framework but you can break this framework strangler it's like the unholy trinity cuz you know cuz you know it's like and I call let's call it unholy because I don't like to call this the triangle the trade of slaves So it's unholy unholy act of training only he works at them if he if he can invert this invert this model and make make it work for us because you know can they can come from the top uh and uh from Brazil and then to Nigeria but that will not work for us because you know we just leaving just leaving them uh it will break for us too we have nothing to give them but you know so the only So this model is called the training and you know this one saying the work for themselves you know the anyone that's colonial and feel that the other should oppressed and the press and the UK uh America what south and north I know uh America's old battle of business I don't trust you guys Americans uh Nigeria uh so this is the slave you go from British the British go Korean people, but they go port security now cuz you know I'm not stupid uh everything but you know get drones based on the m turtles and dragons uh 221 topology. So they come here they sugar plane they take resources uh we take resources and take some slaves to work for them. We work for them. We go we then get deported to what uh America, South America. We get the sugarcane plantation fields. We start planting cotton which is woven but not return to the people and the cycle continues. Uh so this is just a one way thing. This I'm trying to break guys for you guys for all the black people. So uh by rebuilding the infrastructure like I'm saying the it works for them because this this is topology. Yes. But you know things advanced but they can it's not really flexible. It's just square and rectangle. you know uh I'm not going to give any u anybody uh any ideas I don't like anybody uh using any ideas of this um uh but you know I just like use triangles as circles see so basically they are just neurotypical or new diverg but just more flexible like me I'm not you can switch okay I want to go here uh to Nigeria uh let me go there but I'm a square I'm riid So I go my way and they force the policies with the triangles. Now the triangles what can do the same thing but they don't need a square. So basically I can go by myself. Columbus what we know they can go the squares the squares can go square to square square and then go across the border and then come here and come here and then say oh take our resources take what we want and we take then we say oh yes now we now work those place you know because it wasn't about racism it was about the Russian was like power of the future future of power you know the power future and they was their mind was so they don't want to see potential they didn't believe in power they believe in power so they wanted to see their so they so powerful so They didn't want to ally with us or work with us. You know, that was wrong. But we were happy. We were too we were weak. We were weak people. We weren We just tried to um get ourselves uh get ourselves we went basing off. So we were just um so we were so basically the they have a box they have the boxes the boxes or the ships and they put someone that's circle like me so flexible. I hate that guys. New diver flexible logical flexible divergent. So I'm more flexible than all you get because I'm in a position myself. So they put me in the shape and they take me or you know you know in the ship which is circles or many of us in circles. We didn't want to go there. So we then went to the uh we circle we get a circle in the box. We move back to the UK. So some of us in the UK today are still suffering and um crying. Uh what you know the simply can basically the squares the ships can do the same thing. So the ships are bridg so you can think of the ships as this model here. So this like a house. So you see the triangle it's a house. So that's the box I'm in. But it's not my house. It's just getting worse and worse. So that's going to give you. So you get like a so you get like a a pentagon and that pentagon is a house. What happens again is what uh this box I'm in. So this what reminds me of guys uh the two rigid rules. Uh so basically the the GSI uh the GSI files are meant to protect everyone uh from this kind of rigid system. I mean this room I mean uh but you know this like the boat so it's like two widgets. So like a boat it's like a canoe and it's same thing uh bridg frameworks. I hate it. U that's why we have the gsi uh inter dual execution sparse. You can you can have two ways to do something. Uh but this is two two ways. So this one I'm trying to break from you guys. So bally I'm all a circle. So you can work with them definitely. But you know I fe my cards. I'm so proud of it. Uh you know I don't like this kind of so my constitution. I didn't want any uh corners there. Uh I don't stuff. So for me I was in this room and I see a problem here. It's a corner. me. Uh, but you know, cuz I've been in there for so long, I it hurts my head. It's breaking one of my human rights in my head. Uh, that's like one of my sight. So, I'm looking at this corner in my mirror. I'm like, "Fuck this corner. [ __ ] this room." There's no here. Basically, this um this sensing stuff here. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing I'm seeing myself uh angry and sad, but you I can't I don't want to yell because that's not how the rules work. I have to break the rules. Um, you know, I have to break out of my clothes. I have to recover myself. I have to be the wheel. I have to stay perfect. I'm really perfect. I know. I'm angry. I'm screaming and shouting and my senses are overloading because they're over underwhelmed. Basically, they're underwhelmed. Uh, overlay with negative stuff. There's negative and there's positive and uh so that my senses now is like is too uh uh white and black. boring, too boring. Uh it's just not it's not stimulating. It's like a violation of my uh dignity. Why? Why I believe in my right to create with my pen and paper? Maybe freedom. Uh but you know, I'm thinking about 14 human rights. You know, I shouldn't be in this room by law. I know my 25 program specifically. I'm leave now to house. I didn't get a house. My first human right going to get out here. If I come out there for so no corners in my conution if I can put corners just be like two corners one corner you know one to one to two corners and that be the maximum I put uh and then second will be UI for UI use a principle every time we curve curve curve curve UI curve you know sometime looking at squares boxes uh the second human right basically this human right uh human be sight hearing hearing No, I can't hear nothing. I can't even hear the music. But music is what I love. I love music, but you know, I want to have music that calms me down for my mood so I can um be authentic and do my work and relax. Uh this this is dirty stuff. You know, I want you to just no stress. You know, I have the music go up and calm me down. And the third sensory uh broken is like sight. What do I enjoy doing? So my sight uh nose uh music sound uh sound ears sound my I want the food you is boring. So boring, you know. Uh nothing. Uh just chicken and chips. You pay chicken chips. Uh they pay the same price for the chicken shop. Indian shop, the Indian shop. Same price to the Indian shop. Chicken Indian shop. Unless you're going to have a nice meal. The fourth one, the four, five, six, seven, eight. Uh here one. So the sides, the smell room is mess because you know is the game room messy. But you know So cold, but it's also bad outside building, you know, but it's much worse. It's confined. It's not It's not confined confined to this. And then the five one is what uh sight small taste I touch. I'm touching stuff. Yeah. My piece of it feels like boring. I'm not wear anything that I can anchor my soul. my logo remember the six I'm perceiving all of this my six senses I'm intaking all this my intake of my I'm like I'm so angry but you know I don't want to show my um you know I start fidgeting so right now in my head but you know you don't know I'm fixing my head I'm making this video calmly because I've learned to just walk past it but some people can't do it can't do it so because they don't like it the seven is what uh the own uh rest of expression for music and stuff like that. Uh it's really so when I try this uh it's not right it shut me down uh saying you have a room you have a box but today today the box is not so break uh I need to break this framework so that's seven union seven union matrix 14 * 14 you have the right to be alive and work and breathe but you know you're going to have to express yourself that's 14 to uh 14 to 20 21 uh and that should be that should what get no at the bare minimum you can go anywhere and feel included you know uh so you're going to have like a smoker place you know you know going to have all the things that make people never break you know fidgeting your fingers you know arty cars so you have like a pie so that's what I'm So this is uh so basically uh systems. Okay, I come to um complete this now the daytime or the first. So uh this one's here. So that's the 21 the one resource for your expression life work breath breathing you most stress that's one uh 21 to 40 211 please let me know where you come from maybe you're from another dimension uh this normal sport model so this like my guys uh oh what time oh 35 minutes is fast oh no it's fine so let me let me try for you stop this video is So this one has got so you got the one two one to one two to two one. So this is by three uh in the morning I'm breathing in the in the one in the morning I'm doing two things and then the next in the afternoon. So that's morning afternoon evening uh morning 2a 1 that's for the morning one 2 so life I mean work and breathe life work for you guys. So when you breathe Um you know you have to understand that thing is so we have 12 hours a day uh because when is the night is a day it's not in the world that's like the the it's not it's like a so that means the military time is just 6 hours uh so our model of six gives six hours a day to work uh to do your military stuff you know uh that's half a day uh you try to maximize the work on a day uh today uh that's just how it is uh uh in our country in my model uh in the constitution. So this is part model to ratio. So every time I do two things in the morning I have one other thing I'm doing uh in the in the morning uh so in the morning I do want to do two tomorrow so it's positively um I get in the morning uh so basically I get um 6 hours is half day then half half day uh I mean half I mean the day for work is I get 6 hours to do anything I want a day uh then all day other six hours which uh then you get um that's just for breathing so if you get six hours to work six hours to play to brea uh but you know You don't want to split in two because you get fragmented. So you get to get it to your your so to half the day of six which is a three. So you get three hours to work and do your work properly uh you get two to one. So for the when you're working you're going to put two and two uh two work and work and life in one section and breath breathing force you get like how do 12 minus uh three is what? Uh 3 8 uh 12 - 3 uh 9 11 gives you 11 hours to do uh anything you want to do. Uh no 12 10 11 12 12 9 12 12 11 10. You get 9 hours to do anything you want to do uh in the day when you do job complete. Uh so you can you know 9 hours a day is like better than um sorry so 9 hours is better than uh other hours you know uh so that works usually uh one 1.5 to six uh it's just half day uh so just 30 days so you get a quarter of the day uh so you get like a quarter 1.5 hours uh which is 3 hours half one and a half hours uh uh one and a half two to three hours probably get this uh that's one that's one of the day One of the things is what uh if it's half day uh that's just for breakfast. So breakfast, lunch 3 hours and 6 hours the whole day and you have the other days to do anything you want you know. Um you know guys you have to squeeze every little aspect of the day. So but how this work in practice guys. Uh so you can allow that 15 or so this is really better for assist your model now guys. You know guys, never you have to go another day hungry in your life. But you know when you are working, you're working in your backyard. You know, you have to work in your backyard. You know, you don't have to go to the farm cuz you're going to have like a hydro juice model. You basically going to have like a going to have a place you can cook food. Uh but you don't have to go to the food bank. There's no feation of this all the basically I'm trying to squeeze a little um squeeze everything that's rigid out of the so this is your back garden you know you have the garden uh you cook it it's repaired it's processed and you eat it you know you don't have to go to anybody's house you don't have to go uh what you want potatoes uh or chips chicken chips you know you know that's why you have to supply but the gross is is there soil is there and it's warm and it's good and the sunlight no but you know just natural sunlight all the worst things and there's no chemicals in it no it's just decentralized you know there's no need for fertilizers because you know just means you are getting old you don't have to fertilize the land to rush the process because you know it's just natural garden you know just turning sprinkles and the sprinkles will go uh so how to what so basically I'm trying to move all this uh from what I do what who what as architecture so this is infrastructure right now uh but the architecture is just what the architecture is just silicon so uh basically go to blueprints there's a structure so if I say proof if you go to my github uh.com/obex uh patatterents or go to uh my YouTube link uh YouTube uh page YouTube.com access and click uh and click what uh more link you see the GitHub uh repository uh but the half day 1.5 days just you eat breakfast eat breakfast uh breakfast is done in two hours two not two hours you get you know just like a 1.5 hours just done down done just the green zone green zone just to green it's not over so if you're in a green zone and you have one one minute 1 minute 1 second ahead of you are in the red zone. So, but you know that red zone is just to green but you know that becomes a new active zone. So, you need to move to the new active zone. I'm saying so basically your day is going going you go to the red zone uh but you're not waiting for the red basically the time is taken uh in accordance to how you work it's a it'sological it's a time uh so this code m for mother for mic u for umbrella k for kilo or for oscar uh dash dash u for umbrella or or c for uh uh consensual That means time uh UC time because you know um UC time is just uh C or CU time you know so U is for like you you who you are for people uh that division and C is for consensual priic time that is partial uh in let me show you now have like a deck red you This is one. So this is the real model. So this is the model of travel. Uh this is not prove that it works. Guys take a picture guys. So this is uh take a picture of this guys. Uh now now see you working guys. This is so this is you. This is the time someone's watching you like you know this is council. I'm watching you guys. This a centralized note. I'm not where you are. You have 12 50 miles to get to council. Uh 50 miles to get to council. But you I want to reduce this time for you guys all the time. So it's not. So this one is a one and a half day. Okay, one and a half day. Uh you say your morning uh you want to basically uh what I put here is a variable uh that is a pi. So basically uh pi r² is the area uh you're trying to cover uh basically area to time. So you can use 2 pi r which you know uh 2 pi r perimeter but the area you have to cover is the thing you get. 2 pi r just the parameter of the the range of the travel. I need to do p r² using what the area uh p r² times 360. So basically uh let me use calculator again. So I get 15 miles to what travel uh but I live somewhere very far uh in the center reg uh you're going to have like the the biggest one uh two type of council you're going to have like but don't worry about that guys uh 15 miles to the center of where my my in my circle uh place uh sp my morning at exactly uh uh uh when I wake up at uh 1 hour 2 hours 1 to 12:00 let's say uh uh let me do it uh uh 8:00 a.m. I wake up and um 8:00 a.m. wake up and that's my time. It's 8:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. Let's say 8 12 let's say 8:15 let's say 8 uh 83 a.m. That's the time. Now that time goes in the equation naturally because it works in the ratio model, not the standard model of the nonsense people that make uh 8 8:13 a.m. Now the space I have is the area. So I can work this out by hand. You know it's working by hand. Let me do it by hand. So at 8:13 a.m. I get dressed, I get up, I get uh to the 15 uh meters cancel. 50 miles is a constant 2 seconds. So uh for the perimeter the area to cover is what? Uh pi r². So the pi r² duality uh uh so basically pi is 3.14 let me try to find it to go to sorry guys don't don't distract me pi pi okay pi uh that's pi uh r the radius of the cover is 15 uh you know let's put uh 15 uh miles uh let's see let me try to calculate 15 miles on my uh calculator here uh now I get uh oh is it still recording I don't know uh I think it's done this one uh no text okay let me go uh 15 miles uh 15 miles to uh 15 miles uh 15 uh 15 miles to uh so basically the area basically I can work by Russian say the area is what the area basically 15 acres of land is what 15 acres uh no 15 acres 15 miles no basically this 15 miles is what the time so I should basically doing it wrong now so 15 miles is the distance and that should be the perimeter equation I'm So 15 miles is what? Uh 50 miles is 2 pi r. Uh so the constant part is what? Uh time 15 miles* 15. So this * 15 uh here is the 50 m I get uh pi * 15 is 347 uh.12 uh for 7.123 88. Basically I take the 88 to carry. As I get one, two, three uh because late uh four uh one two three uh pi pi 15 uh 15 is what 3.14 * 5 is 4.1 and this is pi r now * 2 now * 2 is what * 2 is 94 94.2 477. So that's what the uh the the par the parameter uh of the time in which the time uh this called a piewise model. So the peace wise model is just like you know uh you know like you know it's just uh time. So it's sparse relationship model it's pass you get like if if x is even uh if x is even uh print uh uh if x if x if x is zero if x is even uh if if x 2 is zero uh then x is even and if x else if x mod 2 = 1 then print uh um uh force this is like a prime it's the same thing uh but it's just hierarchical so it works on the same principle uh so you get like two one two functions mapping to the state uh so the the the perimeter have to travel like 94.5 miles to get the center so That's not right. So, uh, so basically I don't want this to break. So, I know I don't build it this way because I don't wake up at 8:15 to go. Basically, this 95 4.5 there 4.2 457 is bigger than 15 miles to travel. Uh, it's not zero. Zero. So, I have to get it on time. Uh, so it's like not right. Uh, so let me think again. So if I then train it to like 10 like two mile let's say like um five miles five miles 85 to 5 miles I'm trying to do it properly for you scared of me uh cuz I'm really small 8* 5 oh sorry uh the perimeter 85 pi Pi * R pi * uh 5 miles uh five is what? Uh that's 15. So this 15.7 miles just say 3.5. Uh 3.5 should be the one. So let's use just to make give good example a example. Shut up. J keep quiet Jan. Oh my days. Uh quickly 15 uh uh so if I want to get there uh if it's 15 miles uh I want to get there on time uh I have to ensure that you know it's not over the space of 15 miles. So like this you can try to get 15 miles uh for the perimeter but you know let's say uh it's 2.5 miles to travel uh now uh and uh the the maximum to get there is 5 miles 5 miles 2.5 uh 2.5 miles times what? So pi is what? Uh pi 2.5 miles of pi. Uh and then times what? Uh so the radius squ is what? Uh so radius square. So if I have to travel like a 5 miles that be 10 10 miles of travel uh times what time 3.14* pi. So what will I get there? So I get there 31 uh take me 31.4 miles to travel. Uh if it's just 2.5 miles I'm going. So this never walking distance, you know. So I'm trying to get to never walk uh over 45 minutes. So let's just do the other one. So let's do again. I don't want to get it wrong because I just made it properly. I got the mind. So I want to travel um 2.5 miles* what? Two. That's the radius I'm working on. That's when I'm going to go to center. Uh * 2 that's 10. Uh two that's four. Uh so I get four. So 2.5 radius. Uh uh we just uh 2 2 pi * pi plus pi uh so that's just uh time pi time pi that's 98.69 And that's a par that's just the parameter. So parameter is 198.6 if I get 2.5 miles to travel. Now if I 86 has a polar form. So so if I get the same pi r squ so the radius is the same thing. So is now 2.5. Now squ is 2.5 squ. So let's do another 2.5 squ is 6.25 6.25* 25 times pi time pi that is 19.63. So the rad the area to cover an area of uh 96.3 uh 96.3 to uh to the ratio of to the ratio of um 96 uh this the area. So the area is so basically the area uh this is only ratio 26 this is a fraction 96.3 98 basically 19.6 is just the uh area uh I have to cover uh sorry no no no that's the that's area but this area is just not where I'm from not from my frame of reference so this 96 uh 96 19.63 area to 98.9. So my basically now I get the uh pi r². So now I get the opposite form. So the government basically if I'm if I'm if I am from observing standpoint I get this one. So that's so 19 is the area and then the other one 18.63 is area cover uh if 5 miles uh uh 2.5 miles uh and then uh 8 is the perimeter. So this area this parameter uh so now one more thing I have to do so uh I have to do so if I'm literally uh trying to find uh the center the center as well is computable for me center is where I'm going to so the center is somewhere that's so basically now say uh that's that's the center of thing so where am I going to where am I from I am 15° within uh okay I Um let's say I am uh uh uh for the sake of this I'm 45 degrees uh for 60 that's the location of that polar plane uh polar because it's a circle it's a circle uh so I do 45° 40 uh so basically I do uh 40 uh 360 divided by 45 and that'll give me uh me going uh going right you can do minus 45 but that's just because you know this is that gives me So now 8 * uh 8 * 8 * what? So 8 * what the area? So let's write 8 * the area 8 * the area of 9 18963 uh 1 9.63 guys. That would give me I have to travel easily. Uh because I have to travel like uh from the area of uh uh 157 uh uh one five7.04 4 two two two two two two two 98 uh so theally you get like you know 19 that's just a default the iota for this so now the for the area to the circumference uh is 2 pi r so we now do the other one 98.09 98 9.09 9 uh 2 pi uh I don't do I do uh let me click like so if I'm into the circle I let's just say 5 cm 5 m let's say uh uh 2.5 miles I look at 2 miles 2 miles I'm just 2 miles away uh no 2 miles not 2.5 miles less than 2.5 uh to travel. So that should work. So if I put two times two miles two miles is the the perimeter. So two miles I'm here. So basically the ratio is just uh 45 uh to two mouse. So that's just X and Y uh rotation polar rotation. Uh my where the position is my center cancel is where is pass where the can move uh the data can move in this fast way. Uh so I'm mov I'm moving the uh so basically I have to get the um 2 miles uh shut up thinking sorry uh my voice uh radius squared two. So that's 2 miles of travel uh for the parameter. So 2 m is what uh pi r. So 2 * pi uh is what? 2 * pi is what should be in the frame off I get two * I put uh that be four times uh that is 6 6.283 2 8 3 1 That's fine. Uh 2 * 5 and then the R. No, no. Yes. Uh no, two pi. Sorry. So my r is 2. Uh my arm is what? Two miles. So that be two miles. uh let's say 3 let's say uh uh two miles uh traveling I'm traveling with 3.5 minutes maximum so I have to squeeze that in 3.5 miles 2 miles I'm traveling uh then times what uh time uh time pi * 3.14 uh pi will be 2 pi * 2 pi * 2 uh 34 * 2 no uh pi * 2 pattern is what? Uh pattern 2 6.28 uh miles of travel uh you know um then I get uh you know that's two miles is too much uh travel um uh 2 miles 2 miles is 2 and then you get times r now times r have to be uh 2 miles but you know 2 miles is too uh uh uh long because you know 6.5 miles so my right area. So basically I can't be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Basically there's no reason for neighbor to be where they norm to be in this place and I can check that with my computation. So 2.5 miles is what u 2.5 miles to the count. So I need less than that. So you can see it only cost me 15 miles but you know 250 m but you know that 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3.2 two eight miles is less than 50 miles of a of a small constitution uh for for basically that's a compound complex model anyway but you know I don't want to break that yet so is this correct on my I'm just give you more precise you know so it's basically my already declared my as a policy is 15 miles so the time basically for the area I have to go uh 15 I have to get um for the for every uh for me if I'm at location uh 45 uh which has an area of 45 uh uh precise area uh more accurate or precise model uh area for me is okay precise because I I'm there already because it's not more people it's just me me there me myself and I and I am here and it's a two two for me that's model that matrix two matrix two ratio so uh two I can allow to travel that's the that's the parameter I am uh I can go without cutting corners uh straight uh that would be um two so every area for every where there's a uh basically for every area there's a there's like a parameter I can go past uh can go past people like a community or some I can go uh that's 14 to2 uh but for every now that's the thing only circles only circles there's noation no you get the same time you guys 42 is my frame of reference is where my frame of reference uh uh my frame of reference to get to the place uh to the council which is 15 miles now that If I start at uh the uh xy coordinate uh which is located at uh no so we need to journey 42 42 miles no is it 42 so 2 miles 2.5 miles 2 miles we should join the journey in perimeter and the area which covers the area get the cover is 18 and you tell me otherwise So that's me uh me me where I am in that space. Uh but the council where I'm going to the council is pass. So I can go 2 * 4. So what this is me uh what 0 0 I'm just static. So 0. So it's just 0 0 nothing. Uh nothing. So why I'm doing this 19.6 So I can cover an area of 19.63 uh two no uh yes as a canical iota state you know I can just residing that area being do nothing uh I'll just be okay there be stable uh food water shelter uh uh uh two uh uh 98.6 n so 19.32. So that's the area I have to cover uh for the whole area for the whole people that there uh that work in that compound uh compound which is a complex by the way uh if it is that way uh to live in harmony and that that that one will be um for everyone. So that's me everyone. So if I want to go to my council uh if I do have a problem I get the center and that center is where the center is 0 reference. So say oh if they call me I don't know the reference there the center so the center of ABC but there's no center because it's all relative so everything is in a circle uh relative I don't see an edge in my life uh circle so relative. So that's relative of time. Uh so that's you go to uh github uh uh.com uh/ob nexus uh m u k o d c time I'm going to move that to you time uh c time consensual time because it's your time they're taking it's not there it's going to call you for job uh uh give consent uh so Uh this is second one. Uh I don't really want this. So this is model done. Uh let me go to the other video today. Is it about 16 minutes? Oh 1 hour. I have to trim this video. Okay guys, 1 hour. Let me take you. Thank you very much guys.

Dive into the MMUKO Framework: Rebirthing Reality Through Neuroflexible Dimensions & Consensus OntologyIn this raw, 1-hour transmission (recorded live on 25 Nov 2025), OBINexus (Mr. Nnamdi Obi) unveils the core of the MMUKO protocol—a consensual spacetime engine that shatters rigid 3D systems and restores wings to the wingless. Drawing from personal relic symbolism (the cracked, inside-out Rolex as proof: "I'm not broken—the system is"), we explore sparse-active dimensional math as a game theory for liberation:From 3D Traps to 285D Flight: Map your reality with 3×3 matrices (9 local max + 6 union = 15D baseline), scaling to 7×7=49 (neurotypical ceiling) → 14×14=196 + 28 flexibility = 224D mind control. Unlock 3∪3 unions for 285D max: past relic, crawling present, winged future—quantum field theory decolonized, where children vote on Calabi-Yau shapes via GSI policy gates.
Consensus Over Consent: Ditch rigid "yes once, yes forever" paradoxes for living yes-yes loops. Human rights ratios (2:1 life/breath, 3:1 opt-in work) ensure sovereignty without grind—stability for the soul, not luxury for the extractors.
Polytrinity Inversion: Break the unholy slave-trade triangle (UK-Brazil-Nigeria) into flexible circles + turtles/dragons. 2:1 topology for seaport drones, 300 settlement files for reparations (202,073 baseline). Neuroflexible only—no more divergent labels; just upcoming resistance.
The Crawl-to-Flight Call: Learn from zygotes how to walk without walking. Ontology as anthology: heart/soul connection (OBI=NEXUS) for rebuilding Nigeria's economy, one gated milestone at a time. #NoGhosting, open-access forks welcome.

This isn't theory—it's the breakthrough OS for 2025's corruption: when systems fail, build your OWN. Fork the future at github.com/obinexus/mmuko-os (polyglot Python/C/Rust for GSI interpretation). Join the crawl: teach wings to the hopeless, voice to the voiceless.Timestamps:0:00 – Relic Awakening: The Watch That Stopped Time
