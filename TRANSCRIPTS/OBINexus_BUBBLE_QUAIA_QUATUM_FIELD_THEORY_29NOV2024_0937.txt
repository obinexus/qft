Okay. Uh it should be recording now. Okay. Uh click the uh uh uh basically it should be recording now. One second guys. Uh yes uh it's recording. Uh uh everything is recording. Okay guys. So this video means a lot to me. Uh I don't want to write down any more than I did today. Uh but today uh this video is so important. I don't want anybody to judge me. But you know I feel um autistic ADHD asper just in I don't think it's because I believe my um uh um basically I'm going to basically I made my uh legislation uh yesterday. So that's my legislation for the OBS design and constitution uh OA which is public law uh uh public law uh public uh public what OA means public and you see it uh um and then the I J A G I J A G and uh I w that's the public uh related and protested a law constitution uh that protect the most people in society uh like people uh society anymore um with you anyway uh but this is very important with this okay basically I'm 24 years old I'm going to go to Nigeria uh but you know I'm going to rebirth myself as Mr. I believe I am here for a reason on earth, not for God. Don't believe in Jesus Christ. I'm a scientist. But I believe I uh you know I don't believe in Jesus. I never have Jesus. I don't care about Jesus. Um so OB go there. Uh I've got a diploma in computer science and a bachelor uh in what uh diploma in uh uh in uh I believe in business which I can't find. Yeah. I don't care. But you know my whole life focus ontology. Anthology just means um you you you me it's about me uh was looking at uh real world problems and how they affect you uh directly. Uh because that's what uh my all about. You know, I'm really building a constitutional model. But if you don't remember me, uh it's fine. You know, I want you to remember what I did for you guys. So, this is my watch. You see my watch here? You see like a It's never a diamond. This a Rolex. Uh first of all, my Rolex. My mom bought this Rolex when I was like uh uh uh 10 years old. 11 years old. Uh 10. No, I turned uh 10. 10. I was like a new but you know I believe in higher purpose and all higher purpose since my watch is a Rolex a fake one which is crap was new it wasn't like real basically my believe my mom my brother brought it mom didn't want to buy it she just she was my birthday 10 years old she didn't care for my birthday she give me a fake watch this fake was I told the time was working uh you know see the chains the chain chain are jingling you know uh but you know the chains are there this my like if you don't remember this watch and have this place to call a relic. So basically this is my first relic. Uh but you know a relic is just a thing I can hold. So basically when I get this much you know I can sell this watch and sto the time and basically I want to tell the time for you guys. So basically uh 2 to1 marketing you know this like athology. So for me my mom bought this watch and I uh my birthday 9 was in foster care uh 10 years my mom and she don't want to care for me. She says I promutistic EDG asper just learns ability of bipolar uh without but it just tes everything like sources uh later on but doesn't really matter uh everything in the book so I claim that money but no money is not for me it's for you guys so this every time I go out you know this watch falls down it breaks I'm stressed I'm stressed like so basically see the chains they are um they kind of old everything [ __ ] but see this one this like thing here. Uh it's like me present my relic. This is my first relic. Uh I still have it here, but you know I'm thinking of them has changed. So um this like me logo here. Uh see this watch is cracked. Can you see it's cracked? Take look. So it's cracked but you know it's not even working. It's not even take it you know and it's fake. It can't be fixed. So cuz won't take it cuz it's so old. Uh don't even take it and fix it and make it new. So this one saying I'm not broken. The system is so RAM is broken. So I want to take my relic and make it new. Uh so but I can mod this with my business but you know uh this is my first aura uh I sealed. So basically every time I take this watch I wear it inside out inside my like this my persona cuz I'm giving certain amount authentic. So basically it doesn't matter what it means. I'm not broken. Uh this is about time as well. So I put it like this. I'm going to wear this through my put like this. I guess I wear it inside inside out cuz you know it's too big but it's so broken. I don't fit into it. I'm not that big so I don't want to fit into it. So I just wear it inside out. I just if I try to go out right now what's the time? I'm late. I get time on my wrist. Why? Cuz you know it's a relic. It tells me the time but there's no time. The time has stopped. You know there's no time. Nothing moving on. You know we don't have anything new that can fix this watch. It's impossible to fix. You know, I'm building a new stuff. So basically, I can fix this watch myself and renew it. Uh because no one else will uh that's my initiatives uh next initiative. So uh you got the mit, you got the uh information that's from that's the first thing I want to tell you guys. Okay, next. So obviously I'm going to go back do my PhD. Uh but my P is going to last a minimum of three years. Uh life worth uh but you know I'm going to be doing that. I'm going to renewing I believe I don't believe in spiritual world. I believe in a purpose. I'm a scientist. I don't believe in God. I don't for purpose. So basically I believe like you know the purpose I have on earth and this is just to fix um the Nigerian economy but I now see the problem and the whole su I wasn't there to address it directly. So now it's my only chance to address it. I'm 24. So when I turn 24 I'm going to be uh right now I'm - 1 years old. I'm zero years old because I'm you know I haven't come 25 years but 25 years is my PhD 25 years is a new generation so comes out for me gen alpha of bfers gen alpha and beta uh but you know there already gers now uh let me go 25 uh 20 uh plus uh plus what 25 plus uh 25 years has passed so 2050 no basically when was I 2012. So 20 basically generation Z is a 20 basically. Oh sorry my going 2012 2012 plus that's the end of generation Z. So the go plus uh uh plus how many years plus 12 okay so basically to 5. So basically uh 20 2012 + 12 is 20 to the 4. 2012 2012 I don't really care about women guys you know for me this anthology I don't really care uh how my room is uh basically I want to push uh in beer I don't really care about anyone I don't know about this is a new gener you know I think going to suffer if I don't go there and I'm just renewing myself as them so basically uh my avatar is my spirit avatar is them I'm an avatar Mr. But you know I'm obviously I'm a grade but you know my name is Mr. That's my avatar. This is you diver inclusivity network you know that's my business model you live there you work there you breathe there you know you don't need to go anywhere else you know compu it's about stability uh civility I'm rebuild for me I have a computer science I have a diploma I still have a house in the UK I'm a council for me all I want but you know it affects me and affect my personal life you know I look a dirty bastard but you know I look a crazy man I'm not I'm very sane. I I know I'm very sane because this one thing I want to get rid of. Get rid of this thing. I'm trying to say people that are neurody divergent and neurotypical too has to be done guys. You know you guys are not the same. You never get along and so we know why you don't get along guys or how how you know cuz you know you guys are are two different uh kinds of people. Uh so basically uh this is my dragon. You see dragon. Uh now take a picture. If you want to take a picture we taking the picture now. Three two one. This is it guys. This is my uh dragon. Sorry, this is my a bird. This is not a bird. I say this is just like uh what do you call it? Uh my life. So this is like I'm the turtle. I can move slow but I have wings and the wings are flying. So basically uh the muk turtles are the spirit of what you uh the spirit of good and evil. And the zygote is just something that's a child man or woman like you know something that's you got like a a young cat uh a baby cat being born. uh mam something mam has not been born a whale has not been born because that's more scientific than they have carried the wound so we are mammals but we are zygot of m eggs can be m but the chicken egg so that's unborn chicken zy of the chicken so that's what it is so but see this one this one this one is born so that was me I was perfect I could do everything myself but you know I had wings but I was wingless you know I was just walking walking slowly so this is what I want to give you guys so you can do everything yourself perfect but you know you uh wingless, you know. So, I had the wings, but you don't have the wings no more. You can fly like me as a child, you know. You know, that's what I'm saying. I'm going to put the wings wing in the wingless, the the hope in the hopeless and the and the and the voice in the voiceless. Uh you know, cuz I believe in higher purpose uh uh and a higher calling uh than killing people. Uh ontology, the nature of being. Uh so, basically, I'm just introduce um I'm going to go there, but I'm going to calling with you guys literally teaching to you how to crawl. I'm learning some children how to crawl. Uh that's my friends that I missed with the children. So basically my children basically they're going to have um they to crawl uh be crawling uh with me uh children to walk cuz you know if they teach me to crawl I learn to crawl properly and teach me to walk. I learn to walk to talk. So to see how they learn because you know that's more about my people. I don't really care about YouTube. I don't [ __ ] know nothing about see this um thing. You got like a 2D spots. Basically uh if I don't say I'll never say it. Uh so basically um my brain uh basically if you have a 3D uh sparse matrix um anything if you're fully in a 3D reality you are what uh using a 3x3 matrix. So you have the same problem for 2D matrix I have to prove it now because you know I just think that I have to prove it you know. So I have to do it properly. If I never do this I will never do this again. And I don't I only want to do it once. You got to try it yourself. I don't want to be doing again. So, so I'm trying to do it here. So, so you know 3x3 matrix 3 * 3 you get six uh six 9 sorry 9. But if you do 3 + 3 you get uh six six. So what this means you get like six minimum dimensions 3x3 or what? 3x 3 n dimensions. So 6 + 9 is what? Uh 15 dimensions of what? Uh dimensions uh that's pass. Now that's pass relationship is not fully that's the world you live in. But that could be mapped to a 2D world. So basically that 3D eyes can be 2D 2D 2D perception. Uh but you know that's the do now. If I don't do it now you guys never get it. So you know 3D uh that mean 15 dimensions you get uh in the real world you know in the real world uh you know just uh because you know you got three minimum 15 15 maximum so you're going to just say 15 maximum but you go to remove your move this bally 3D or it's just why I don't control 15 dimension only call control my dimension 3D that's there but it's 15 dimensions maximum if there is theoretical uh and then what I'm saying to you is this you If I want to perceive the real world I have my own dimension my mind but my mind is 7 * 7 basically I get like seven dimension uh 7 union 7 union 7 maximum so that's 7 unit 7 * 7 is what 7 + 7 is what uh 14 now 14 7 * 7 is 49 and that give me 63 uh things I can control based on my sensory eyes nose mouth but you know there are six senses what I observe what I control what I observe, you know, I can interpret while interpretation layer uh the GSI files, you know, uh gossip uh gossip uh gossip programming language uh interpretation files, you know, for poly systems and then the GS files, the gossip language, you know, uh basically the interpretation is for policies interpretation and full system cover, Python, C, Rust, etc. You can have that, you know, if you're not important policies in um the GS GSI files, you're really [ __ ] up system for yourself. Uh now uh now uh 49 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 13 13 now four five six. So basically goes into three dimensions you can act on uh bas. So CC is a uh so basically this three world this uh 16 dimensions just what normal neurotypical normal people have normal uh neurotypical people have people not just like you know awkward you know but I'm extruding ordinary so I'm going to try to prove that uh now so we got 62 dimensions and now we got uh 7 * 7 so we got 49 we got 63 dimensions you know uh just the minimum the minimum uh life work breath uh segment so you live you have to be have to work and breathe in a dimension you have to have like a century in this kind of 3D world uh which is what uh 16 to 3 What? 15D the 3 to 15D uh 15D method. I'm using protected for another plane a 4D plane. Uh I'm just going to try to frame myself only and end this video. Uh before I continue this video done a long time ago. Uh so uh minimum minimum 16 uh to 16 union uh 15D 15D uh where D is a dimension of the unity uh union and district for the neural brain brain because you know uh you know that's is sensory uh sensor you have um 63 human rights uh by default in condition you know minimum who can finally take this past you if you can even get the minimum that they kind of kill you killing your ability to do Okay. Uh but you know your 15 dimensions is just uh for not 13 15 dimensions quantum field that's my model. We got 15 dimensions in quantum field. So we have to explore all the dimensions with all our sensors you know uh based on what we can control and we can't control uh for quantum field theory. Uh but you know my so that's basically five to seven uh for the worst neutral people that's five uh can only observe five dimensions. dimension they can't really see anything take anything in if they don't have the dimension scene the blind seven they can't really take in seven that mean can't really whatever they saw uh which is duality there you know I'm talking about that myself only so I believe I am uh in the dimension of 17 to 14 uh I'm so sensually I believe I'm like you know if a double 7 plus 7 is what uh 14 so I can control all my dimensions I have like a a strong of my mind. I can see what what could see uh if they let me in, you know, but I need consensus, you know, uh my cons. So uh so you got like 14 uh * 14 uh which is the maximum senses. So 14 + 14 uh so calculator uh 14 * 14 try to do 14 uh equal to 196. Now 14 + 14 is equal to 28. So that's supposed to broke uh doesn't mean broke. I wish I broke the box. Even though you diver people, that's my but don't care. Basically, I'm no I feel I call myself new flexible. I'm so flexible. I'm not divergent. I'm just myself existence, you know. Uh so we got 6 8 + 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14. Now we get uh 44 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 and then 20 224 dimension uh units. I have the dimension to the four I can control to 63 because I believe my mind is four dimensional. So I'm aware of my state and state who I am where I'm from. So basically my mind is 40. So I believe I'm being projected to 3D world for a reason for purpose to your world. Uh but you know it's just my proof you know I'm so I can see stuff people don't see easily. I can pick up stuff that people don't know of and uh but you know I use my mind to do that. uh what's my problem of mind control basically my mind of a matter product you know if I have all control of the mind I lose all control of the body but you know that's what I'm saying it's just like that you know so you don't want to die so it's just like the mind you know you know mind state of the body you know sobody all the consciousness you know that means they're dead or alive and they're being polarized So uh one more thing guys here to um this is my thing of riches fix Nigeria constitution have a life but you know if you see in dimension you know one day you see me oh this is uh you know I'm busy dimension four dimensions the four dimension which the higher plane but the high plane is not the goal here me going back to that plane is not the goal uh the goal here for me oh time Okay, let me not end this now. Let me end at 30 because I said the time for me to show try to make you know bring up a new flexibility people myself as a child myself. I'm trying to figure out how this why people are keep them. Uh they have five they can do their own things. I don't really care. I want the best life ever because if I ever stay in that dimension uh I want to return to my constitution what I do you know why I made for the people that actually care so I I know uh I know I return to not to Mar but to the soul and the soil bly not the soul not the source like you know the sand the place from returning the which is of from which is from the heart so basically I'm going to give you back twice double you know from the I give you one. That's what I have for you. I'm going to give you two. That means I have double. Don't give you guys uh two uh tological sovereignty concentry and we walk with you. I will learn to walk with you guys uh your children but you know um heal us all change. I I there's no consent. You have consensus in the world. You uh basically the consent is I don't like it. I consent. So if I consent to something and you say no. Uh do you say I don't consent to it? You know it's just too rigid. So do you consent to me using your phone number? No. Uh do you consent to me using your phone? Yes. Uh oh that's fine. So basically uh I've now per said yes once. So um the consent uh is just wrong. Consent once forever. Uh so that's wrong. So that's consent done. So no consent to my phone consensus. Now consensus means what you get. Do you consent to using your phone? Uh yes. Do you consent to me using your phone? No. Do you consent to me using your phone? Yes. So two yes. Yes. Are you using your phone? One. Yes. I'm not sure. So that's a paradox there. Uh consensus paradox. I never consider using my phone unless they are um uh know what they're doing on my phone. I can't view my uh uh bank account inside my data when I use for life. I didn't want to touch my phone even uh one more thing journey to face. So I I'm going to do my schedule B this year. Uh I'm going to do uh J basically basically let me just try with the work guys. No no no this work. No, no, no. This work one. Sorry. Sorry, guys. I'm thinking of the work one here. It's very dirty, guys. I look dirty, man. I'm not so 14 to 2 to1 ratio. Uh 14 human rights seven. So, basically going to have the maximum of expression and that includes your uh your standard human rights seven * 7 or 7. That's just like your shout out uh for living. Uh living just uh basically you're going to have like a 2 to one mark. So you get like a 2 to1 mapping. So if I have a 17 to 14 to 7, that's like two human rights. So one, but I can live and breathe. I can live and breathe. But I cannot work. So if I want to work my my after 28 uh like 7 plus 21 to uh 7 uh so I can work a little bit uh not optional. Uh if I want to work as optional to work to work, but I want to opt into work. uh uh that's 247 to to 7 which is a 3 to1 ratio human right uh thing you know I don't anyone working in the position I want you guys to enjoy life uh so not for the population because you know I want to join with you guys too uh the culture things I missed when I was in UK maybe have a girlfriend I don't mind so here basically this is me Is there any thinner forly? Uh yes, you see this is not the one I brought the wing one. So basically I am not broken system is so I have wings as a child which system never let me use my wings. Uh so basically the wings are uh this is a butterfly a dual mock. So if you can interally beauty this could be a butterfly or water turtles. Uh but turtus just flies on the has wings when they want to fly. Uh the butterflies on the battlefield. So if once fly do I have a turtus and the turtles will be able to fly because two ones you can be um flexible uh like me flexible flexible uh the world divergent is banned so uh before I continue I'm going to ban so basically these are a lot of things happen in the world I'm basing the entire UK economy from my constitutional model um you know because you know they can can build their own they can build their own constitution uh but you know the the pattern spike in four years. Uh that's 22,43 because they indirectly supporting um just me 2073. Uh it's just because it's four years 25 plus 24 is what uh 73 years uh US Brazil 73 because you know Brazil you know the slave choice. So you go from uh British to B of B of Benin and the B of Bin will be uh south the coast of the coastal areas uh where you can get away with this easily and from coastal ed basically it works for them because it's just so rigid you know fixing their framework but you can break this framework strangler it's like the unholy trinity cuz you know cuz you know it's like and I call let's call it unholy because I don't like to call this the triangle the trade of slaves So it's unholy unholy act of training only he works at them if he if he can invert this invert this model and make make it work for us because you know can they can come from the top uh and uh from Brazil and then to Nigeria but that will not work for us because you know we just leaving just leaving them uh it will break for us too we have nothing to give them but you know so the only So this model is called the training and you know this one saying the work for themselves you know the anyone that's colonial and feel that the other should oppressed and the press and the UK uh America what south and north I know uh America's old battle of business I don't trust you guys Americans uh Nigeria uh so this is the slave you go from British the British go Korean people, but they go port security now cuz you know I'm not stupid uh everything but you know get drones based on the m turtles and dragons uh 221 topology. So they come here they sugar plane they take resources uh we take resources and take some slaves to work for them. We work for them. We go we then get deported to what uh America, South America. We get the sugarcane plantation fields. We start planting cotton which is woven but not return to the people and the cycle continues. Uh so this is just a one way thing. This I'm trying to break guys for you guys for all the black people. So uh by rebuilding the infrastructure like I'm saying the it works for them because this this is topology. Yes. But you know things advanced but they can it's not really flexible. It's just square and rectangle. you know uh I'm not going to give any u anybody uh any ideas I don't like anybody uh using any ideas of this um uh but you know I just like use triangles as circles see so basically they are just neurotypical or new diverg but just more flexible like me I'm not you can switch okay I want to go here uh to Nigeria uh let me go there but I'm a square I'm riid So I go my way and they force the policies with the triangles. Now the triangles what can do the same thing but they don't need a square. So basically I can go by myself. Columbus what we know they can go the squares the squares can go square to square square and then go across the border and then come here and come here and then say oh take our resources take what we want and we take then we say oh yes now we now work those place you know because it wasn't about racism it was about the Russian was like power of the future future of power you know the power future and they was their mind was so they don't want to see potential they didn't believe in power they believe in power so they wanted to see their so they so powerful so They didn't want to ally with us or work with us. You know, that was wrong. But we were happy. We were too we were weak. We were weak people. We weren We just tried to um get ourselves uh get ourselves we went basing off. So we were just um so we were so basically the they have a box they have the boxes the boxes or the ships and they put someone that's circle like me so flexible. I hate that guys. New diver flexible logical flexible divergent. So I'm more flexible than all you get because I'm in a position myself. So they put me in the shape and they take me or you know you know in the ship which is circles or many of us in circles. We didn't want to go there. So we then went to the uh we circle we get a circle in the box. We move back to the UK. So some of us in the UK today are still suffering and um crying. Uh what you know the simply can basically the squares the ships can do the same thing. So the ships are bridg so you can think of the ships as this model here. So this like a house. So you see the triangle it's a house. So that's the box I'm in. But it's not my house. It's just getting worse and worse. So that's going to give you. So you get like a so you get like a a pentagon and that pentagon is a house. What happens again is what uh this box I'm in. So this what reminds me of guys uh the two rigid rules. Uh so basically the the GSI uh the GSI files are meant to protect everyone uh from this kind of rigid system. I mean this room I mean uh but you know this like the boat so it's like two widgets. So like a boat it's like a canoe and it's same thing uh bridg frameworks. I hate it. U that's why we have the gsi uh inter dual execution sparse. You can you can have two ways to do something. Uh but this is two two ways. So this one I'm trying to break from you guys. So bally I'm all a circle. So you can work with them definitely. But you know I fe my cards. I'm so proud of it. Uh you know I don't like this kind of so my constitution. I didn't want any uh corners there. Uh I don't stuff. So for me I was in this room and I see a problem here. It's a corner. me. Uh, but you know, cuz I've been in there for so long, I it hurts my head. It's breaking one of my human rights in my head. Uh, that's like one of my sight. So, I'm looking at this corner in my mirror. I'm like, "Fuck this corner. [ __ ] this room." There's no here. Basically, this um this sensing stuff here. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing I'm seeing myself uh angry and sad, but you I can't I don't want to yell because that's not how the rules work. I have to break the rules. Um, you know, I have to break out of my clothes. I have to recover myself. I have to be the wheel. I have to stay perfect. I'm really perfect. I know. I'm angry. I'm screaming and shouting and my senses are overloading because they're over underwhelmed. Basically, they're underwhelmed. Uh, overlay with negative stuff. There's negative and there's positive and uh so that my senses now is like is too uh uh white and black. boring, too boring. Uh it's just not it's not stimulating. It's like a violation of my uh dignity. Why? Why I believe in my right to create with my pen and paper? Maybe freedom. Uh but you know, I'm thinking about 14 human rights. You know, I shouldn't be in this room by law. I know my 25 program specifically. I'm leave now to house. I didn't get a house. My first human right going to get out here. If I come out there for so no corners in my conution if I can put corners just be like two corners one corner you know one to one to two corners and that be the maximum I put uh and then second will be UI for UI use a principle every time we curve curve curve curve UI curve you know sometime looking at squares boxes uh the second human right basically this human right uh human be sight hearing hearing No, I can't hear nothing. I can't even hear the music. But music is what I love. I love music, but you know, I want to have music that calms me down for my mood so I can um be authentic and do my work and relax. Uh this this is dirty stuff. You know, I want you to just no stress. You know, I have the music go up and calm me down. And the third sensory uh broken is like sight. What do I enjoy doing? So my sight uh nose uh music sound uh sound ears sound my I want the food you is boring. So boring, you know. Uh nothing. Uh just chicken and chips. You pay chicken chips. Uh they pay the same price for the chicken shop. Indian shop, the Indian shop. Same price to the Indian shop. Chicken Indian shop. Unless you're going to have a nice meal. The fourth one, the four, five, six, seven, eight. Uh here one. So the sides, the smell room is mess because you know is the game room messy. But you know So cold, but it's also bad outside building, you know, but it's much worse. It's confined. It's not It's not confined confined to this. And then the five one is what uh sight small taste I touch. I'm touching stuff. Yeah. My piece of it feels like boring. I'm not wear anything that I can anchor my soul. my logo remember the six I'm perceiving all of this my six senses I'm intaking all this my intake of my I'm like I'm so angry but you know I don't want to show my um you know I start fidgeting so right now in my head but you know you don't know I'm fixing my head I'm making this video calmly because I've learned to just walk past it but some people can't do it can't do it so because they don't like it the seven is what uh the own uh rest of expression for music and stuff like that. Uh it's really so when I try this uh it's not right it shut me down uh saying you have a room you have a box but today today the box is not so break uh I need to break this framework so that's seven union seven union matrix 14 * 14 you have the right to be alive and work and breathe but you know you're going to have to express yourself that's 14 to uh 14 to 20 21 uh and that should be that should what get no at the bare minimum you can go anywhere and feel included you know uh so you're going to have like a smoker place you know you know going to have all the things that make people never break you know fidgeting your fingers you know arty cars so you have like a pie so that's what I'm So this is uh so basically uh systems. Okay, I come to um complete this now the daytime or the first. So uh this one's here. So that's the 21 the one resource for your expression life work breath breathing you most stress that's one uh 21 to 40 211 please let me know where you come from maybe you're from another dimension uh this normal sport model so this like my guys uh oh what time oh 35 minutes is fast oh no it's fine so let me let me try for you stop this video is So this one has got so you got the one two one to one two to two one. So this is by three uh in the morning I'm breathing in the in the one in the morning I'm doing two things and then the next in the afternoon. So that's morning afternoon evening uh morning 2a 1 that's for the morning one 2 so life I mean work and breathe life work for you guys. So when you breathe Um you know you have to understand that thing is so we have 12 hours a day uh because when is the night is a day it's not in the world that's like the the it's not it's like a so that means the military time is just 6 hours uh so our model of six gives six hours a day to work uh to do your military stuff you know uh that's half a day uh you try to maximize the work on a day uh today uh that's just how it is uh uh in our country in my model uh in the constitution. So this is part model to ratio. So every time I do two things in the morning I have one other thing I'm doing uh in the in the morning uh so in the morning I do want to do two tomorrow so it's positively um I get in the morning uh so basically I get um 6 hours is half day then half half day uh I mean half I mean the day for work is I get 6 hours to do anything I want a day uh then all day other six hours which uh then you get um that's just for breathing so if you get six hours to work six hours to play to brea uh but you know You don't want to split in two because you get fragmented. So you get to get it to your your so to half the day of six which is a three. So you get three hours to work and do your work properly uh you get two to one. So for the when you're working you're going to put two and two uh two work and work and life in one section and breath breathing force you get like how do 12 minus uh three is what? Uh 3 8 uh 12 - 3 uh 9 11 gives you 11 hours to do uh anything you want to do. Uh no 12 10 11 12 12 9 12 12 11 10. You get 9 hours to do anything you want to do uh in the day when you do job complete. Uh so you can you know 9 hours a day is like better than um sorry so 9 hours is better than uh other hours you know uh so that works usually uh one 1.5 to six uh it's just half day uh so just 30 days so you get a quarter of the day uh so you get like a quarter 1.5 hours uh which is 3 hours half one and a half hours uh uh one and a half two to three hours probably get this uh that's one that's one of the day One of the things is what uh if it's half day uh that's just for breakfast. So breakfast, lunch 3 hours and 6 hours the whole day and you have the other days to do anything you want you know. Um you know guys you have to squeeze every little aspect of the day. So but how this work in practice guys. Uh so you can allow that 15 or so this is really better for assist your model now guys. You know guys, never you have to go another day hungry in your life. But you know when you are working, you're working in your backyard. You know, you have to work in your backyard. You know, you don't have to go to the farm cuz you're going to have like a hydro juice model. You basically going to have like a going to have a place you can cook food. Uh but you don't have to go to the food bank. There's no feation of this all the basically I'm trying to squeeze a little um squeeze everything that's rigid out of the so this is your back garden you know you have the garden uh you cook it it's repaired it's processed and you eat it you know you don't have to go to anybody's house you don't have to go uh what you want potatoes uh or chips chicken chips you know you know that's why you have to supply but the gross is is there soil is there and it's warm and it's good and the sunlight no but you know just natural sunlight all the worst things and there's no chemicals in it no it's just decentralized you know there's no need for fertilizers because you know just means you are getting old you don't have to fertilize the land to rush the process because you know it's just natural garden you know just turning sprinkles and the sprinkles will go uh so how to what so basically I'm trying to move all this uh from what I do what who what as architecture so this is infrastructure right now uh but the architecture is just what the architecture is just silicon so uh basically go to blueprints there's a structure so if I say proof if you go to my github uh.com/obex uh patatterents or go to uh my YouTube link uh YouTube uh page YouTube.com access and click uh and click what uh more link you see the GitHub uh repository uh but the half day 1.5 days just you eat breakfast eat breakfast uh breakfast is done in two hours two not two hours you get you know just like a 1.5 hours just done down done just the green zone green zone just to green it's not over so if you're in a green zone and you have one one minute 1 minute 1 second ahead of you are in the red zone. So, but you know that red zone is just to green but you know that becomes a new active zone. So, you need to move to the new active zone. I'm saying so basically your day is going going you go to the red zone uh but you're not waiting for the red basically the time is taken uh in accordance to how you work it's a it'sological it's a time uh so this code m for mother for mic u for umbrella k for kilo or for oscar uh dash dash u for umbrella or or c for uh uh consensual That means time uh UC time because you know um UC time is just uh C or CU time you know so U is for like you you who you are for people uh that division and C is for consensual priic time that is partial uh in let me show you now have like a deck red you This is one. So this is the real model. So this is the model of travel. Uh this is not prove that it works. Guys take a picture guys. So this is uh take a picture of this guys. Uh now now see you working guys. This is so this is you. This is the time someone's watching you like you know this is council. I'm watching you guys. This a centralized note. I'm not where you are. You have 12 50 miles to get to council. Uh 50 miles to get to council. But you I want to reduce this time for you guys all the time. So it's not. So this one is a one and a half day. Okay, one and a half day. Uh you say your morning uh you want to basically uh what I put here is a variable uh that is a pi. So basically uh pi r² is the area uh you're trying to cover uh basically area to time. So you can use 2 pi r which you know uh 2 pi r perimeter but the area you have to cover is the thing you get. 2 pi r just the parameter of the the range of the travel. I need to do p r² using what the area uh p r² times 360. So basically uh let me use calculator again. So I get 15 miles to what travel uh but I live somewhere very far uh in the center reg uh you're going to have like the the biggest one uh two type of council you're going to have like but don't worry about that guys uh 15 miles to the center of where my my in my circle uh place uh sp my morning at exactly uh uh uh when I wake up at uh 1 hour 2 hours 1 to 12:00 let's say uh uh let me do it uh uh 8:00 a.m. I wake up and um 8:00 a.m. wake up and that's my time. It's 8:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. Let's say 8 12 let's say 8:15 let's say 8 uh 83 a.m. That's the time. Now that time goes in the equation naturally because it works in the ratio model, not the standard model of the nonsense people that make uh 8 8:13 a.m. Now the space I have is the area. So I can work this out by hand. You know it's working by hand. Let me do it by hand. So at 8:13 a.m. I get dressed, I get up, I get uh to the 15 uh meters cancel. 50 miles is a constant 2 seconds. So uh for the perimeter the area to cover is what? Uh pi r². So the pi r² duality uh uh so basically pi is 3.14 let me try to find it to go to sorry guys don't don't distract me pi pi okay pi uh that's pi uh r the radius of the cover is 15 uh you know let's put uh 15 uh miles uh let's see let me try to calculate 15 miles on my uh calculator here uh now I get uh oh is it still recording I don't know uh I think it's done this one uh no text okay let me go uh 15 miles uh 15 miles to uh 15 miles uh 15 uh 15 miles to uh so basically the area basically I can work by Russian say the area is what the area basically 15 acres of land is what 15 acres uh no 15 acres 15 miles no basically this 15 miles is what the time so I should basically doing it wrong now so 15 miles is the distance and that should be the perimeter equation I'm So 15 miles is what? Uh 50 miles is 2 pi r. Uh so the constant part is what? Uh time 15 miles* 15. So this * 15 uh here is the 50 m I get uh pi * 15 is 347 uh.12 uh for 7.123 88. Basically I take the 88 to carry. As I get one, two, three uh because late uh four uh one two three uh pi pi 15 uh 15 is what 3.14 * 5 is 4.1 and this is pi r now * 2 now * 2 is what * 2 is 94 94.2 477. So that's what the uh the the par the parameter uh of the time in which the time uh this called a piewise model. So the peace wise model is just like you know uh you know like you know it's just uh time. So it's sparse relationship model it's pass you get like if if x is even uh if x is even uh print uh uh if x if x if x is zero if x is even uh if if x 2 is zero uh then x is even and if x else if x mod 2 = 1 then print uh um uh force this is like a prime it's the same thing uh but it's just hierarchical so it works on the same principle uh so you get like two one two functions mapping to the state uh so the the the perimeter have to travel like 94.5 miles to get the center so That's not right. So, uh, so basically I don't want this to break. So, I know I don't build it this way because I don't wake up at 8:15 to go. Basically, this 95 4.5 there 4.2 457 is bigger than 15 miles to travel. Uh, it's not zero. Zero. So, I have to get it on time. Uh, so it's like not right. Uh, so let me think again. So if I then train it to like 10 like two mile let's say like um five miles five miles 85 to 5 miles I'm trying to do it properly for you scared of me uh cuz I'm really small 8* 5 oh sorry uh the perimeter 85 pi Pi * R pi * uh 5 miles uh five is what? Uh that's 15. So this 15.7 miles just say 3.5. Uh 3.5 should be the one. So let's use just to make give good example a example. Shut up. J keep quiet Jan. Oh my days. Uh quickly 15 uh uh so if I want to get there uh if it's 15 miles uh I want to get there on time uh I have to ensure that you know it's not over the space of 15 miles. So like this you can try to get 15 miles uh for the perimeter but you know let's say uh it's 2.5 miles to travel uh now uh and uh the the maximum to get there is 5 miles 5 miles 2.5 uh 2.5 miles times what? So pi is what? Uh pi 2.5 miles of pi. Uh and then times what? Uh so the radius squ is what? Uh so radius square. So if I have to travel like a 5 miles that be 10 10 miles of travel uh times what time 3.14* pi. So what will I get there? So I get there 31 uh take me 31.4 miles to travel. Uh if it's just 2.5 miles I'm going. So this never walking distance, you know. So I'm trying to get to never walk uh over 45 minutes. So let's just do the other one. So let's do again. I don't want to get it wrong because I just made it properly. I got the mind. So I want to travel um 2.5 miles* what? Two. That's the radius I'm working on. That's when I'm going to go to center. Uh * 2 that's 10. Uh two that's four. Uh so I get four. So 2.5 radius. Uh uh we just uh 2 2 pi * pi plus pi uh so that's just uh time pi time pi that's 98.69 And that's a par that's just the parameter. So parameter is 198.6 if I get 2.5 miles to travel. Now if I 86 has a polar form. So so if I get the same pi r squ so the radius is the same thing. So is now 2.5. Now squ is 2.5 squ. So let's do another 2.5 squ is 6.25 6.25* 25 times pi time pi that is 19.63. So the rad the area to cover an area of uh 96.3 uh 96.3 to uh to the ratio of to the ratio of um 96 uh this the area. So the area is so basically the area uh this is only ratio 26 this is a fraction 96.3 98 basically 19.6 is just the uh area uh I have to cover uh sorry no no no that's the that's area but this area is just not where I'm from not from my frame of reference so this 96 uh 96 19.63 area to 98.9. So my basically now I get the uh pi r². So now I get the opposite form. So the government basically if I'm if I'm if I am from observing standpoint I get this one. So that's so 19 is the area and then the other one 18.63 is area cover uh if 5 miles uh uh 2.5 miles uh and then uh 8 is the perimeter. So this area this parameter uh so now one more thing I have to do so uh I have to do so if I'm literally uh trying to find uh the center the center as well is computable for me center is where I'm going to so the center is somewhere that's so basically now say uh that's that's the center of thing so where am I going to where am I from I am 15° within uh okay I Um let's say I am uh uh uh for the sake of this I'm 45 degrees uh for 60 that's the location of that polar plane uh polar because it's a circle it's a circle uh so I do 45° 40 uh so basically I do uh 40 uh 360 divided by 45 and that'll give me uh me going uh going right you can do minus 45 but that's just because you know this is that gives me So now 8 * uh 8 * 8 * what? So 8 * what the area? So let's write 8 * the area 8 * the area of 9 18963 uh 1 9.63 guys. That would give me I have to travel easily. Uh because I have to travel like uh from the area of uh uh 157 uh uh one five7.04 4 two two two two two two two 98 uh so theally you get like you know 19 that's just a default the iota for this so now the for the area to the circumference uh is 2 pi r so we now do the other one 98.09 98 9.09 9 uh 2 pi uh I don't do I do uh let me click like so if I'm into the circle I let's just say 5 cm 5 m let's say uh uh 2.5 miles I look at 2 miles 2 miles I'm just 2 miles away uh no 2 miles not 2.5 miles less than 2.5 uh to travel. So that should work. So if I put two times two miles two miles is the the perimeter. So two miles I'm here. So basically the ratio is just uh 45 uh to two mouse. So that's just X and Y uh rotation polar rotation. Uh my where the position is my center cancel is where is pass where the can move uh the data can move in this fast way. Uh so I'm mov I'm moving the uh so basically I have to get the um 2 miles uh shut up thinking sorry uh my voice uh radius squared two. So that's 2 miles of travel uh for the parameter. So 2 m is what uh pi r. So 2 * pi uh is what? 2 * pi is what should be in the frame off I get two * I put uh that be four times uh that is 6 6.283 2 8 3 1 That's fine. Uh 2 * 5 and then the R. No, no. Yes. Uh no, two pi. Sorry. So my r is 2. Uh my arm is what? Two miles. So that be two miles. uh let's say 3 let's say uh uh two miles uh traveling I'm traveling with 3.5 minutes maximum so I have to squeeze that in 3.5 miles 2 miles I'm traveling uh then times what uh time uh time pi * 3.14 uh pi will be 2 pi * 2 pi * 2 uh 34 * 2 no uh pi * 2 pattern is what? Uh pattern 2 6.28 uh miles of travel uh you know um then I get uh you know that's two miles is too much uh travel um uh 2 miles 2 miles is 2 and then you get times r now times r have to be uh 2 miles but you know 2 miles is too uh uh uh long because you know 6.5 miles so my right area. So basically I can't be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Basically there's no reason for neighbor to be where they norm to be in this place and I can check that with my computation. So 2.5 miles is what u 2.5 miles to the count. So I need less than that. So you can see it only cost me 15 miles but you know 250 m but you know that 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3.2 two eight miles is less than 50 miles of a of a small constitution uh for for basically that's a compound complex model anyway but you know I don't want to break that yet so is this correct on my I'm just give you more precise you know so it's basically my already declared my as a policy is 15 miles so the time basically for the area I have to go uh 15 I have to get um for the for every uh for me if I'm at location uh 45 uh which has an area of 45 uh uh precise area uh more accurate or precise model uh area for me is okay precise because I I'm there already because it's not more people it's just me me there me myself and I and I am here and it's a two two for me that's model that matrix two matrix two ratio so uh two I can allow to travel that's the that's the parameter I am uh I can go without cutting corners uh straight uh that would be um two so every area for every where there's a uh basically for every area there's a there's like a parameter I can go past uh can go past people like a community or some I can go uh that's 14 to2 uh but for every now that's the thing only circles only circles there's noation no you get the same time you guys 42 is my frame of reference is where my frame of reference uh uh my frame of reference to get to the place uh to the council which is 15 miles now that If I start at uh the uh xy coordinate uh which is located at uh no so we need to journey 42 42 miles no is it 42 so 2 miles 2.5 miles 2 miles we should join the journey in perimeter and the area which covers the area get the cover is 18 and you tell me otherwise So that's me uh me me where I am in that space. Uh but the council where I'm going to the council is pass. So I can go 2 * 4. So what this is me uh what 0 0 I'm just static. So 0. So it's just 0 0 nothing. Uh nothing. So why I'm doing this 19.6 So I can cover an area of 19.63 uh two no uh yes as a canical iota state you know I can just residing that area being do nothing uh I'll just be okay there be stable uh food water shelter uh uh uh two uh uh 98.6 n so 19.32. So that's the area I have to cover uh for the whole area for the whole people that there uh that work in that compound uh compound which is a complex by the way uh if it is that way uh to live in harmony and that that that one will be um for everyone. So that's me everyone. So if I want to go to my council uh if I do have a problem I get the center and that center is where the center is 0 reference. So say oh if they call me I don't know the reference there the center so the center of ABC but there's no center because it's all relative so everything is in a circle uh relative I don't see an edge in my life uh circle so relative. So that's relative of time. Uh so that's you go to uh github uh uh.com uh/ob nexus uh m u k o d c time I'm going to move that to you time uh c time consensual time because it's your time they're taking it's not there it's going to call you for job uh uh give consent uh so Uh this is second one. Uh I don't really want this. So this is model done. Uh let me go to the other video today. Is it about 16 minutes? Oh 1 hour. I have to trim this video. Okay guys, 1 hour. Let me take you. Thank you very much guys.

github.com/obinexus/mmuko-os
github.com/obinexus/mmuko-osSo guys, I'm free myself as a children. I'm a child right now in my mind. Uh this is the real or fake uh problem. Real fake. Two one problem. Sparse defense. But you know, I don't believe in defense, guys. It's just called sparse defense. But you know, um you know, but it's really sparse offense. You know, SP defense is like uh acting on your own. Basically, you defend something. You only care for yourself. Uh but I'm thinking about myself as a child. You know, I'm defending myself, my interest. But you know people can infrotain me because you know I'm the only myself. I'm not the only one that's neurotypic. So basically if the I'm the only autistic child in the world this model work for me. Uh but you know the people that autistic that do disclose the autistic I'm the only one that's with autism edgy and neurody diver model. Uh oh is this recording? It should recording. It's not recording I don't think. Oh yes it's recording. Yep it's recording. This is not recording. But basically sparse defense just means for myself sparse in between all of myself my new defense people and sparse attack all of us working together uh to achieve a goal uh but you know all of us not them not the enemy uh not neurotical people in that uh because people are your enemies anyway because they don't fit into your uh but do you fit into your so I'm building my own utopia basically so guys very important this this video is very important this is a real fake duality problem uh So basically um I want a gun as a child. I didn't really I wanted to do it when I was four years old you know but you know four five years know I was trying to find way get guns honestly you know bically get toy gun there's a toy gun in class but I didn't basically if you paint the gun black all my children real dark black to make it real automatically you know that was like oh it's a gun you know uh but you know that's the fake gun uh thing so the gun is uh real but I never got hold of a fake gun because I was told to not do it with them because they're bad people are the best people that press the free but I wanted a gun because I was scared my friends uh uh I had like a three guns the rule so basically I'm going to give you the thing this is about me being my friends with guns um this is onical research about myself only uh but this a point by me uh they will know uh they never know which one to load basically this the entire point um basically the two gun well basically I have two one gun one gun you know it's like a gun and one two gun now uh this entire put two guns sleep in the dark you know basically uh you have two guns all the time but you don't know you think it's random so basically if you know the whole point children so I want all the children to have guns you know at least one gun at least two guns two guns minimum for the child you know themselves uh but this is the part of the uh right to act basically your rights I'll give you my right you know you guys introduc you guys from this uh because I trust myself. My people, you know, uh uh 3 to 9, this how I feel as a child. This how I felt. My friends, I knew the artistic too cuz they acted like me just by the way they acted. I feeling to hear uh basically statement expression intent on this guys. Uh we're not broken. We're just bent like we're just too flexible for them. We're too flexing. We get guns guns and Google guns eventually guns. Uh basically uh I'm 24 uh I went to uh ref council and council said no to me so I'm framing it in the authority perspective and they so what I do this is my human rights basically I said hey council I told you I'm autistic edges there's going to be something in there I know my rights I have more around the housing act 198 and the housing or what uh the house 2014 uh 14 oh you can't get the house we don't care about you I said fine so what do I do rights to act basically my rights. So this right uh I don't want to define it because I really want to start sketching legislation and draw them. I'm not doing that [ __ ] Uh so basically I my first time and talk to you guys statement I state I need a house I say that coherently I relay that what they do nothing now that's a violation now now people thinking no I'll just go find another house say no because they're so powerful this so big because that's the duality problem if they're so big they can do so much to one person uh because the framework works for them but they want you to be scared of them automatically because they have money to do it so it's like a scareongering fearongering really because they want you to stop fear I ask you now the police going to come but they not the power authority to do that if they do that you know ever do that that's because they are violating their code of conduct whatever they're put in place in the first place the entire UK that's what we know they can do that uh but it's not should not be in their interest to do that they should not be thinking about that even they should be thinking about oh no wants a house get a house which they didn't do oh he go to sleep so 189 might be is like you know I am autistic ADHD I'm disabled you know in that framework I'm disabled I'm not disabled I'm flexible so I said um you know the right to disability you know you know this guys if you're going to get sued you know my rights no so I found the I look at the UK government I found the legislation now of the section 189 819 got a so I said I'll give them 189 that's the most important one you know I could have g1 a char I can give them anything I want to do uh but that's what I need because I need that one that's about my uh I'm a disabled part uh in a care home and hus gets violation I need a house authority I get free house in Cambridge PhD done they said no first time then I walked there I called on the phone and said oh I'm going to write an email so I wrote an email to them uh github.com/obexbox- entries textbooks uh dash entries or textbook entries you know things that are solved you know by myself basically this is a diary for myself immediately I'm I'm matching the strategy uh because I don't trust them. You can call the police and lie. So basically when I do that I record it you know the police gets involved uh so it covers that police too. So you basically trust no one or nothing unless you can prove you can trust it. You can construct the proof of the police help me get food the police you can't trust no one only your people only people you are you building it need to be rigid for them and flexible fully flexible for you can go anywhere you know. So basically it's not flexible for me in Indonesia because I'm an adult but I feel like a child but I'm a child at heart. I'm not an adult. I don't say I'm believe adults are like um 98 adult years. Uh uh but if I turn 90 I I feel I feel old. I start feeling old. I start feeling older thinking old thoughts but I don't have old thoughts to think about you know things really pass. It's just drama that never addressed me. Basically if I go to member state have to give two children guns uh one figure and two row guns. Everyone starts with a figure uh but you know uh allowed a figure but they have to have a consensus to get two guns. So it doesn't really matter how they do it but you know I can keep the backup one slowly give them guns you know uh because I'm researching myself as a child who is n autistic person having a gun uh who you wanted. So the goal is to have every child have a gun and defend themselves against the bureaucracies but not by shooting by shooting toys and things that shot in like a shooting ranges. go to shoot and shoot all the things that meet basically they keep one gun in somewhere localized and they keep another gun in shooting range example they have to shoot that gun in the shoot only uh which is the idea of theology projects researching my autism uh only normal people normal people don't like normal people but I don't hate them but don't like them either uh so uh I uh that's valid once fight it twice uh want to know I express okay I need a house 2014 you know this so what it did to me so basically how 1996 uh resolution 98 uh free house for me I didn't get it came no PhD done now I'm going to Nigeria to do it now I've already got I've got uh I already got my back million basically I have to think about it properly I've got 300 60 million on my bank account already so that's 30 30,000 30,000 is a want not a need So that's a free house. I want I say it's a need. It's a need basically thing. So it's basically I can argue now legally under that was that was my human rights violated wasn't a want. I didn't say I want it. I said I need it. So if you say I need it I need it. You know because I need to be sustainable. If I ever said I want it they say oh it's not human rights bound. You know the is not reasonable. So you be uh put it as possible in your framework only uh and isolate them in their framework. I see what it uh so important for them to break it. If you say I don't I don't shut you guys know that's the idea here guys. So you want you want uh it's never the down you need uh you need you know you never need permission consent to this your right um you know so I statement is expressed now my is no way no way I am going all through this bureaucracy I'm going to buy a house and leave in the UK I'm going back to Nigeria uh I'm a king of Nigeria by the way I have a bear uh I have a land there have a a land there and it's been wasted. There's no there's just mines on it. I'm like basically I can't even go on that land cuz you know there's bombs there. Uh so I need to get like a a mine uh thing to blow it up, you know, before I ever put my foot in it. I don't trust these people on my on my land. But that land there is not being used. There's nothing is doing. It's just like a direct uh but you know the children are meant to build on it. So basically I'm going to get you to start building my dream constitution too. But I'm going to be leading them guiding them. What do you what do you want? But I don't want the adults involved. So basically, the adults has to be there with their children for guidance. Uh but but I don't want to be doing that for the adults because they're adults. So basically, I want full control of the children to have two guns, but I don't want to do that to their parents. Uh I want them to feel free in my land, you know, because I'm still a child at heart, you know, if I said I'm a child, I'll lie to you. Uh so basically that's basically uh the intent layer is uh basically express um the basically like an actionist. So A basically the housing in Cambridge I two came two basically two counselor said to me the counelor sent to me the I'm homeless no homicide my country is not signed I say my contract is not signed yes my contract is not signed I just want to help you guys are funny uh then that's 30 money they see from their bank account to my for them personally to see that 30,000 now that's 30k but that's not enough to do anything for them so saying no for me to act on my right 60,00 is not enough for me to buy a house in Cambridge for PhD anyway. Uh but they won't they won't say no to me enough enough so I'm taking coming back to Nigeria uh for myself but I don't want to spend any money on what I need uh because that's just my human rights so I have to move that money to my uh wanting uh acquisition things I want to do building stuff building stuff I mean to I mean to be there uh expressing T3A uh tier 3A 30 to 60,000. Uh that's basically I guess maximum. Uh I have to opt for the maximum if I want to ever want something again because I say ah the lie the bureaucrats I'm lying at them you know stupid I don't like them I don't have girlfriend then that you basically consider is not uh uh given uh it's given automatically to act in it. You can't you can't take away someone's auto that's how they structured how they work internally. Uh but that's a structure of room blooming. You can can't fix them in boxes cuz I'm I'm just expanded the box and blew it up. So they don't want basically they're scared of me even staying in this room. Uh cuz they open the door for me sometimes you know they uh they have to do this cuz you know oh so smart. Uh but but that's what I'm saying. I've just blown the whole box. So basically I've just literally the box they box and just like blown the corners off and stra boxes. So they have to make a new framework for me just me for you guys through you guys too. So that's what the uh unit is need to start doing. Uh if I call them uh they should uh be acting on your right uh to own guns. I want you guys to have guns. Every child have two guns one in the shooting range. Uh next bunker system. So this is security. So the bunker systems are really important. So you get guns there. Uh but the bunkers are where the guns are get the help. Uh so you can get to the bunkers and get um any guns in the gun store. Uh but there's no gun store guys. There's only a gun bunker. So I don't trust you guys yet. So uh so you have to have a compound a double compound. You got a two to one mapping for this compound model. So 2 to one compound. If you want to go to a gun compound gun plaza, that's a 42. So let me see let's start with compound myopia my vision of my constitution. So you have the land but you know that's two. You're going to have a the the way you're going to have the gun the the gun gun range but that's going to be too long. So you're going to have two gun rangers two gun rangers already but that two gun rangers got a two to one mapping. So every two government has to be one uh isolated unit you know but what breeding spaces you know going to have a plaza there you know but the plaza is going to be what uh for the guns uh and keeping but because you have a plaza you have to get a bunker now the bunker in the plaza is constitution guard so the plaza is for children only so you can have gaming there you can have videos there you can make content children's content you know that's the feature I want you guys to have So that's the power cell. So if you want to go shoot a gun, you go to where the two guns, but you know that's double protected. So you have like two shells. The shell basically I'm think of a shell model there. So you have like one shell protecting the most important thing that can kill people and whether they're fake or real. I don't really care. But you know uh anyone that lives in a child has to earn being in that area zone, you know, because they have to earn going up. I can't just walk into the closet. But basically it's just housing allocated for children that will if I want a gun if I ever want a gun my system for me would kick me out if I ever try to get a gun and kill myself know just pointing at myself I'm scared but I never know cuz you know I'm scared of shooting myself uh cuz you know that's a red flag to me so the topology to give it now properly because I uh you got two rings around the where the gun doesn't matter where it As long as there's no uh this equity in it, it can be at the center but not the center because there's never equity at the center. You know, people just run to the center for anything. Uh so basically two to one is like sequence the sequence of the mapping or sequence. So series what is basically if if I make a mistake once you know that's enough to trigger myself to stop and fooling myself twice. Uh what you um basically if I'm making a mistake once make you a mistake you my friend the typical diverent you're my friend I make you a mistake you me uh in this framework so you can say oh yes you can say yes I made a mistake I made a mistake you made a mist you can say you made a mistake here and you know and then you correct me then I do that again uh second time that's a violation of intent already you know basically you got two statements uh it doesn't matter whether it's two statements this I say or two things I express no there's no there's no duality there's no two ways about it or two things I intend to do like kill you know so two that's what I'm saying to you guys you know if I do something twice you know I'm doing it on purpose automatically I'm telling you because that's working on uh but you know uh but you know what's confusing to people about coming uh uh patterns so basically I can do it two one I can do two to one can do one to two uh two times but you know that's a pattern you recognize but you don't know what the pattern is because you don't what I'm trying to do uh what I'm trying to obtain but you know that's that's what I work on I'm giving my framework here so I can do two one two two one one two one two2 uh but not do it fully as well because there's so many ways I can do it I'm so flexible you know so basically guys formalize this basically for the framework I want to try you guys to use MOS code uh most code uh for visual uh input all the things you do to computers uh children that are adults they call themselves adults in the the UK frame of the English framework. So um basically I'm a child and adult sometime uh but you know I'm just to have like this kind of system series execution. So uh parallel z can work parallel in concurrency but that's most code transposes. So my site here works on most code because the mo code it can be a binary classifier but it's not a mo code because it's easier to basically it's the codec system. It's a neurody diverged codec based on a 7* 7 uh matrix. uh the code is so it's MOS code but for sensory sensory stuff uh observation I don't want to do computation yet um yeah so one basically there will be no two ways uh which they will they will never know basically if if I try to if I get a fake gun uh they don't know it's real gun uh that's the same point two guns are real sleep in the dark one walk in the light two to one basically the I'm a rebel rebel what's uh time or 17. Okay. The Asian ratio of as a or king who refus to by war that fears armed children. I love armed children. I'm an armed children. The fake one is theater. Sam as a king. Um I live the high to to mock when the mockery come. Uh basically when councils police the adults quot a free child mad just put him in a box they see their own shape terror and phrase freeze facial access. So guys, you know, basically, you know, I'm giving them insomnia. Uh they can't sleep at night. I love insomnia people. Uh that's actually people that want to think and do stuff. Maybe you can try and do something today, but they want to do they were never too too silent. Um they wait for their ancestors to beat my teeth, beat my breath. This is not about bullets. This is about sparse defense. So basically the sparse offense model if you want to attack. Uh but you know, if you just defend yourself and you are fine, you don't need to defend. You're just uh in a position where there's a lot of war, there's a lot of noise, but the ro is not you. You are the signal but we can see you basically it's just basically defense is just you defending yourself only in the framework of neurody divergence what you see yourself as um based on open sense framework um for um new modeling so the thinnest possible shield is thick touches child and you touch death you know so basically but death never speaks only the fake gun screams so basically p you think oh think I'm holding a fake gun you know but I am holding a fake gun mimicking the fake gun but you know and screaming basically two ringers is full open. Basically, one fake gun is for perception. You know, people can see the fake gun or see the fake sound you're making or see um basically it's the perfect consensus between you can switch it around. Basically, if one day you don't have a your fake gun, you know, you can get a fake gun quickly, you know. Say it's good because you know it's a toy gun. You can just get it, dispatch it, you know, but it's not two fake guns, you know. That's just have two real guns. You have if you Oh, I lost fake gun today. What do I do? I can't scare my friends, my fake guns. I can't join my gang, my group friends. I want to join my friends. But the guns I really do actually when I'm busy have fake guns but you know uh when the things get high when I start rebelling you know I have to get my protection to get two guns uh one for backup and one for uh because I have to consent to that gun. So basically they start to get scared but the SC was wrong. Basically it's a MOS code for the uh for my cognition because that's not solicit it's a codec system a MOS coder uh that mean can code stuff uh and process and code based on the function frameworks and decode stuff decoder so I can use a computer uh with a computer in C uh and write the code to do this automatically for me I'm I'm the kind of advanced child uh I don't fit in their frameworks I don't want to fit in a room their rooms basically I I don't want to be in a room I never did I want a house under but you know now I'm going back to my origin uh story and this is a legacy I want to leave behind forever and ever. Okay, one more thing. Okay, Ni guys, uh basically the Chinese haven't trying to uh implement living forever thing. Uh but you know, uh mind uploading. Uh but it's going to break. I don't really care. Um you know, only the water can afford it anyway. Uh but you know I want you guys to start thinking about um your your future um and if you guys want to um uh try to do basically you guys are you guys are children of future children uh adults and children basically as an adult you say sign you know if you don't sign you don't become an adult ever again uh you can only sign it twice uh twice you never sign a third time you sign once a child uh then you say okay I own consent for being a child I want to be a mu adult now you sign once again uh for a child uh uh nice stay that channel time get your children to play everything uh now you get an adult but you know uh I'm saying so the it's going to work for everyone for now play with their kids everything in the space that children are meant to be with guns uh but I don't want anybody breaking debts so I'm worried I'm worried about these people so it's not 3 to one effort for the adults the actual one that are 18 or 18 plus you know because you can you adult in 15 mean 10 15 to me uh you can do everything yourself. You don't need book telling you can do everything yourself. So you're an adult in the real world for me. Thank you very much.
Okay, so this video is probably going to time 
out, but you know, I have to upload the two videos then if it does time out. But this video is 
very important to me. It's I'm really in I don't really care what I am. I just get to my house. 
If I get a house now, let me tell you where I go my life. My right private life, but just somewhere 
guys, the stupid place I'm still in. It's the back garden. But you know guys, I'm still like my room 
there. But I don't want to show you guys that this building that's basically the pipe, the toilet 
stuff, but I don't really care. Um so basically uh this is my uh something I call the breath 
dance you know because I'm eel uh the breath to life uh you have to breathe or the breathing 
cycle the cycle of breath uh dance breathing you know if you live in the constitution you know you 
know I everything you know so basically I so it's for me to enjoy my life a message to me this is 
myself you know it's a new beginning so Mr. Obi where I go now. Yes, I call it the bread 
dance. It's like an ebo man spirit of the masquerade masquerade of the spirit and 
we go uh basically I go not I'm going to dance for you guys. I want to play a song 
uh breathing working. It's like it's like an expressive song. It's got a lot of money in 
it. I'm going to show you some moves of it and then we'll see what you think. Um the moves 
you know let me see what you think of it. Uh but you know uh so it's really from the 
if you go to like medium uh.com uh slop bi can find the poem spirits of the masquerade 
you know and then you got the other poem the other poem a masquerade of the spirits you know 
uh basically the two the duality uh parality uh parality function you know I don't want 
to think about that right now until I dance because I'm really to Nigeria for my PhD. 
Uh cuz you know I get came to Cambridge to suit 40 million pounds and that would be my my 
business account. Uh but I have to make sure I do things properly. So I get to Cambridge all my 
blueprints and everything properly. But you know the internet is getting restricted in Nigeria. 
You know funny enough. Uh but you know that's just normal Nigerian bureaucracy. You don't 
want to do anything better. Don't open the borders anymore because you know they have money. 
bad people have money and we good people have the very poor the very small percentile of the bad 
people um have the biggest power and the you know say polarity system you know it's not fair 
basically bad people have big power and we good people have no just I know in Nigeria you know 
I'm not telling you metaphoria I just know that you know even you have like a breakthrough of 
them you know those people are very good people uh okay so now this is the breakdowns you know 
so I'm going to try to do it but I don't care if it goes viral so like you know So what do you 
have? What's your problem? You look like some kind of injured person there. You know I want to 
go viral but you know I don't really care what it does. You know I only care if it goes viral in 
the Nigeria. So basically um I'mra so bically means come and take. So so I'm to breathe new life 
into your eyes like you know mom did this mean oh my mom. So it's a child this child leg is injured. 
I breathe life into their legs and they can walk. This man has a walking stick. I breathe, you know. 
It's not walking on water, nothing. It's not walk like Jesus. [ __ ] nothing. I'm a scientist. I'm a 
computer scientist. I'm a B drink. I'm not Jesus. I don't care about Jesus. I know who Jesus is. I 
never met Jesus. So, I come my hand my hand break. I bring new heart. It's healed. It's healed. 
You know, it's called a breath. But, you know, it's a new life and building. You know, it's not 
about all the breakthroughs like really for me about the healing process. You know, you can push 
your business model. When system fails, build your own. But for me, it's more personal and spiritual 
and uh cultural and ancestral and historic, you know, cuz that's the most to me. So, I got 
be dancing me blowing stuff, but I have thin air, you know. This one has a problem right now 
in my face. I give him breath. This one has the money. I give money and I give him I give him 
money, but the money comes back, you know, double me double. So, I I give big money. Don't give me 
big money. So, basically, that's what it is. Um, it's about uh healing. Um, I really feel this way 
because, you know, I have a persona, you know, I'm not I'm not a boring person. I thought being bored 
or being cold. Okay, let's play the money song by I want to I want to I want to shove My body first though, guys, my bank accounts ago. Take a look at it like this. If I don't get money to my friend money problem to build everything for myself. Let's 
build the future. a lot. Thank you. Thank you. So cool, man. My bank account. problem. Go for the food. Go for the water. Go to 
the shelter. Double everything for me. I'm calling IQ. Just turn my computer. Send me money. 
Send me my email. Send my bank account. I give you double. Give me double now. 
Give me I give you double money. Give me the double money. I give you double food. 
Give me double phantom tax. You pay your phantom tax. You know phm tax. You know 
I go. I just your go back home. Go back. Come on. Breathe. Breathe. My friends, I miss them. Thank you guys. Thank you. Yes. Thank you 
guys. Perfect. The reward.
so, basically, altitude, basically, I got a randomness, you know, Brian's randomness, he's, you know, basically, he's the right kind of randomness I need. If Brian has any input, you know, he's autistic, too, or ADHD, on the spectrum, you know, he can pick a monster, a monster energy drink, for me, and, you know, that can go to what? Oh, Thomas, Thomas is going to pick for me again, so, basically, oh, Thomas can, basically, he can shuffle this process, now, if Brian picks for Thomas, one time, to Thomas, and Thomas then, oh, yes, I think Namdi will like this, and then one says, okay, Ryan just picks a random one, and then, random energy monster drink, and then, and then, Thomas, my friend, who was my station, picks one, oh, I know Namdi, I think I know Namdi will like this, and then, you know, he just, basically, he just takes my input, and, say, gives me give it to Thomas, monster A, hey, Ryan, how's monster A for Namdi? Oh, Namdi says, oh, Thomas says, autistic, I'm autistic, too, so, no, he will not like monster A, he will like monster D, but, you know, because F, he does, he's picking F from E, basically, he's going to say, basically, monster F, he hasn't come out yet, he has not come out yet, so, monster F is like, oh, monster, but he, you know, he's like, he's going to say, monster A, it's more similar to monster E, and then, Thomas says, oh, yes, monster E is the best for him, and then, he gives it back to Ryan, and Ryan does, again, oh, monster E, oh, because, you know, Namdi likes E, but, you know, that F tastes, E tastes a bit like, too random, too easy, so, basically, random, just, random is just a randomizer, Ryan's just a randomizer, and Thomas is just a Noah, he knows quite like, so, I could then, and then, the final one to pick can be one of them, because you need one more monster, so, Ryan can pick one monster for me, you know, so, basically, A to E, A becomes E, E then has to go back to what Ryan does not know, because I want a random monster, if I don't want a random monster, I want something like, I mean, you know, I go to Thomas to pick it, so, that's what I'm saying to you, so, directly symbiotic evolution, I direct visualisation of my taste buds, and it's computable as well, you can write functions that have too public, so, A and E are, you know, monsters, now, Ryan, Thomas gets E, now, he gets back to Ryan, Ryan is a funny decision, don't basically, I eliminate A, A, because, you know, A is what we've done, now, Ryan says, okay, let me pick a monster D, so, so, it should be D, this one, for Namdi, and I get a monster D, and I drink monster D, but I never knew what monster D tastes like, you know, because, you know, I didn't expect it from this to shuffle, I can shuffle it, it's like shuffling, it's like, if I want to know something, if I want something that I most probably like, that I don't know to show, I'll pick what, I'll start with what, I'll start with the Thomas one, so, Thomas knows, most knows why I like, so, I like, he knows, I like B, he starts with B, he can start with B, you know, or, if I just give him B, I like B, you know, I give him B, I like B monster, now, B monster is what? Grandpony gives a B, I give it to random, give it to Ryan, oh, Ryan, can you find something, I don't know, Thomas gives a random, he picks, oh, oh, he don't know what he likes, I don't know what he likes, so, I'm gonna randomise it, Ryan says, oh, oh, oh, give me C, he does a random one, because B next to C, you know, because, you know, we don't, we have some bites for thinking, so, B, C, and then, oh, he give me C, but, you know, he likes C, because I think he likes C, I think he likes C, because he gave me B, why do you pick C, I don't know why you pick B, C, because you just randomise it with your own head, you know, your own personal, your own personal measuring principle, and then C becomes what? B, now, B is what? B is now the, C, B and C eliminated, because I gave them, and I get, oh, okay, so, because B, I still get D, so, I get D, still, but, you know, it's a random process, I'm saying, because, you know, I guess we get D, whether I know it or not, so, but, you know, I can do this many times, it's just one time I've done it, one shuffle, so, I go D, let's go shuffle, so, this I shuffled between why I know, and what I don't know, I can do shuffle this two or three times, I can simulate this, basically, I can shuffle monster A to F between Ryan and Thomas, so, I get something I, I don't know, a little bit, you know, a little bit of information from a machine, or F, these I don't know from a machine, I'm saying, so, you know, and then I can get some, I can evolve accordingly, it's getting my own consciousness, it's getting my way of working, so, basically, I can take this monster and leave the shop, and the shop will give me the food, and I'll get the food, and if I want food, what does that, you know, I do want a monster today, and I do the monster, and I go do my work, you know, I don't stay in the shop too much, I get, you know, the machine can run this, a vending machine can do it, probably, a vending machine can get a food, do it, because, you know, if I get bored of tasting something, you know, it's like, basically, you got trees from one mapping, so, you can work a bad Russian life, so, you just want, basically, three public keys, Ryan and Thomas, heal each other, they heal each other, literally, you know, because I'm autistic, but, you know, and then I get one, I'm the private person, I mean, they don't know me, anyway, they don't know me, but, you know, they do their job with equity, it's like, decentralised equity, they do it according to what's already there, in the framework, you know, if I was, basically, if I was, because I'm a private person, I remain private, I remain private, you know, I'm my private at all times, you know, and just do it with what I request, based on my rights to it and my eligibility, based on the 30 human rights for drinks, their food, water, shoulder, and then, if I want, I can do one, I can be the one person to do two, basically, if I want to request myself, I know the two people, I request someone I know and someone I don't know, you know, you know, I prefer this one, you know, I prefer this one, I can give me an advocacy, I can go to the right advocacy support group, the right one, number one, and the second advocate group, number two, you know, the person, the two people who, like, someone I don't know, someone I know, I don't know, and then, if I know three people, they know two people know me, and I don't know them, they can assist me, equitably, you know, because they can do half the job, I'm just going to do half the job, listen, health and social care, design and technology, it doesn't really matter what you're doing, but why is this place lower in the real world? It's basically the reduction principle, where I call minimalization. So, basically, you've got a muko OVI US, heart, or soul UX library. Basically, this is like a JXX JavaScript XML, but, you know, it's based on what you see, is what you mean, and what you, by that's what you see, is what you mean, and what you mean is what you see. Basically, there's three layers to it, so try that truth. So, I'm giving you an update, so basically, you have a UI interface, I type in what I see, what I type in with the instability keyboard, what I see is what I'm getting, what I'm getting, what I'm getting, but this is broken, because you know it's the one person, but, you know, if I get what I mean, is what I see, I see. It's really bad, because, you know, it's really bad, it's all broken. So, my one is looking, so the kind of cool one would be, it's just two kind of cool representations, you know, but, you know, they are two kind of, you should have an isomorphism. So, if what I see is what I mean, but that could be what I touch, what I feel, what I sense, you know, what I sense is what I mean, but, you know, what I mean, I mean to sense, I see A, I touch A, I smell A, I observe A, I act on A, but, you know, that's the seven, I act on A, because there's somebody acting, I'm continuing my change. So, seven times seven, if I see it, I react to it, let me see, it's what I mean. So, that's one way to do it, but I can see, it's what I mean, what I see is what you mean, what you see is what you mean. Or, I can say, what I, you see, what I or you see is what you mean. What you and I see, you know, is what I mean, can be both ways, oh, and you say, what you see is what you mean, what you mean, what you see is what you mean, what you see, and again, what you see is what you get, you know, the things where you see is what you get, you know, it's basically, you know, what you see, bi-directional, so, I can, I have a map of this, I can have like two public keys here, for myself, and then, that's for me, you know, my project, you know, public keys, my access would be next to the oak. And then, these are the two people that heal themselves, two, after these services that overlap functionality. Well, the problem here is that these two services only do the job that they're meant to do. So, but you know, I have to keep updating them, keep updating them, but you know, as other things change, as the policy specifications change, you know, as the world evolve and get worse or better, I don't care shit about the world, basically, as the, as I see, as the world gets more entwined in that action, I have to adapt my systems, you know, so basically, the service I have to offer has to go, update, and I have to go, I have to go to another downtime, to update some services, you know, and you know, but I want no downtime, you know, I want to get my things done. So, what I have to do is get, I want to, so basically, there's a policy now, guys, which gives us some standards, so basically, I get through, basically, I am now the private key here, I'm imagining the two sites, two services that overlap X service, Xnot, Muscles, you know, the work, they get work for the, basically, the stack system, the stack, but they can't evolve, they can evolve, yes, and basically, you can add more, you can have more services, have infinite private keys, infinite public, so you can, basically, take one service, A, and get Selim Monster A, and get Monster 8.1, 8.1, and equal two, based on X, you know, but that's basically A, but you know, you don't want to do this, you want to go backwards, you want to make sure that the foundation is stable. So, what you do, is take service A, and then you have what, you have a seated, what A, you see the private key, have a seated two to one, or you have the private key, you have the private key two to one, two to one, two private public keys, to one private key, to one private key, and then you get one private key to two public keys. So, that's how you have to have your own public set, you know, and that's the same, so don't want one mapping of your, excuse me, the private key has the two, you see, basically, you are keeping two private keys, secret, you know, system, so basically, if the, if your private key breaks, you know, you don't talk to, you don't look at the public sector, public servers for others, you know, you manage your thoughts, your private key, your knowledge, and how you diffraction your knowledge, how the fragmented, how, basically you remove all knowledge from power, all knowledge, all knowledge from power. So, that, so Uche has own service, Uche services, urban access division, department Uche, the knowledge, the documentation, division board, the standardisation spec, you know, that's mathematically enforceable, forming to comply with new standards, and this division, like 2014, you got the Charles City Act in UK, 2025, and you got the American one in 2020, the 2020, the 2016, 2020, I believe, the online safety act for U.S. citizens, which I don't really know about, studies, sorry, so you guys are always putting to the fact, today's date is today, 2nd of 15th of, 2nd of November, 2025. So, I'm gonna say to you guys, I'm gonna say to Poland, excuse me, it's a policy because, you know, you can tailor one service to one way, because you know, two ways, you can, what do you do for U.K., U.K., but you know, if you wanna do for U.S. or Nigeria, you have to have this work for everyone. So, for everything you do, you have to show these two probably as public U.K., two nodes, services, the American two nodes, but you know, for you, you have to think of yourself, you know, so you have two nodes, so you have two to one magnet for the photo system, for what I sent on the internet, so you can heal yourself, the two public keys can do their job, you know, but you know, it's not triad, it's not specifically, if I'm to live in Nigeria, that's NG, the gov.ng, or the gov.biafren, or the biafren position, I think about the country, the biafren, and the biafren needs a want, I think about, oh, yes, two keys, two public keys for the biafren, because you know, I am a biafren, and I will put two public keys, but you know, it's more sustainable for me to have it. And then, for my constitution, I put an extra two to one, because it's one key I need for my constitution. It's not one key public key. It's usually for the biafren constitution, or how public section, you have two to one, for the IW, IW, low, you have two to one, and for the order I, indigo, I for indigo, J for jump, I for india, indigo, and then that's two to one. Basically, it's mostly compliance with regulation and systems in the world, that's kind of work, and I doubt. No matter what I make it random, big random start with randomness, a random seed start with something I call random, or I determine it is random, because you know, if nothing is random, you can start with a seed that's not random. You get it? You can pick something based on your bias. We all actually bias, we're not children, we're not babies, we're not zygotes. We're zygotes that are actively observing and learning, and preserving stuff. So, to preserve, basically, the two to one map is not a joke to me, guys. It means all the world, you know. I can map anything to two to one, you know. Now, one more thing. So, I'll talk about HOBIX, which stands for hot, OBI, hot, Mr. Hot or So. So UI use library. Now, UI, user interface, user interaction. UX, UX, so you got the OBI, hot, and then you got a user interface, and user experience, sensory preservation, based on the quality assurance, two to one mapping for safety critical new divergent infrastructure, as well. People that get bored, this is seven times seven QA text, and whether the technology must be mapped to seven times seven, to show a seamless fear, uncertainty, and doubt, mitigation, as a foundation of user, UI, user interface, and user experience systems. Okay, thank you, guys. Let me stop this video. Let me stop this video. Stop.
This is the cam. Can we start recording? I can hear my own voice. The wife is recording. Everything is live. Ok, so I mean, ok guys, this video is from a company called Mikko OS. Mikko Open Systems. I got the blueprints alright. I think they should have been there as a child, you know. They should be built. They should have been in Nigeria when they were building it. When they abandoned the stuff and they want to help us, you know. That is just it. And of course, there is a truth. I'm not going to use anything. I think they should be in like, you know.
Because all the blueprints are ready. All the money. They will go with Lagos now, you know. They should be there in the navy, in Nigeria, and the British State. And they should get up. We ordered this one a bit. Ok, now, Mikko OS. Mikko Avatar Systems. Basically, you can't have OBI OS. It doesn't reflect the nature of reality. You can't have Garcia Lang OS. But you know, I want to make them possible. But you know, I'm saying that Mikko, M for mother, M for mother, U for umbrella, K for kilo, and O for Oscar. You know, that's what I'm saying. Mikko Internet, all the things. Mikko Opera Systems. Polyglic Opera Systems. That is the surface layout. That's going to be interactive anyway. But you know, basically, you've got the hardest software. Your spirit, your soul. Your spirit is like, you know, your keyboard. My spirit is what I want to do. And my soul is the computer. My body, my heart is like the hardware. And you know, I'm just becoming a bit autistic. My heart is the hardware. And my spirit is what I want to do. My heart is the spirit. With these really systems. My soul. Basically, this is meant to build, build, build. Work, work, work. The software is literally, guys, the software has to see you as wanting to do something. We have an evil heart, good heart. I don't really care. You know, I think they're objective like that. So my evil heart is like, I'm thinking evil stuff. I'm a computer, so let me do that. Good heart system. Basically, the computer is broken. The storage is broken. Everything is fragmented. So I'm building some of the computers. But I want to start with a Muckoo keyboard. And how this works for interprets. Especially you are the signal. You are the, basically, you are the noise. You are the noise. You are the signal. You can tell the computer everything you want to do. Literally. You know, everything. You can speak to it. You are the signal. You never hear the noise. If you hear the noise, let me just use the computer. Because, you know, if you're kind of noisy, you know, let me just use something. You're doing something that the computer is going to do. So you are the signal. You are channelling your aura. Because your aura is like, I want to get this done. I want to do this, you know. I want to do this because I can't. I'm broad blocking down money, time, effort. You know, the audio is fine. But you know, if something, I am the problem. You're not the problem. You're just the signal. But you become the noisy signal. You become the noise in the signal. You become lost in your own signal. So you become confused, basically. What do you want to do? How do you want to achieve it? So basically, this is, I'm trying to do a system already there in the robot. So NUCO OS is just NUCO services, products, services, operations. So basically, you've got service.operation.ob, nexus .department.division.county.org. You know, I need to search for NUCO search engine. You know, I can just get all the internet. So you go like the BFRN country, you know. Because basically, BFR was just Nigeria. What did in Nigeria? BFRN in Nigeria. But you know, it's not Nigeria. Basically, BEA means count. But you know, in that country, you have constitutions. You go, that's the county. You know, so you have like a YWU or HA county, but the public, basically all humans are protected under the county. Because you know, if you have 30 human rights in the constitution, you have 30 additional human rights, you have 30 human rights in Nigeria or modern day BFR. You have 30 human rights under 30 human rights to protect you when you live and you work in the constitution. And when you live, when you end the constitution, you know. Because that's the same. If you have, everything is double, double, double, double.
I'm going to give you guys a double. If you have money here, money here, if you're breathing in Nigeria, you're just surviving, or just how you will, you know. You come to your constitution, you're double your breath. You know, you double your breath, you know. You double your work, your life and your work. All you think you're doing is you're making change, actually change. So I'm not going to let this roll down. It's a policy. So you get protected from fragmentation and you give back to the community in and out, in and out, until we get these people who don't want to, who want to stay there and, you know, be isolated outside of the constitution. We don't really care. Because, you know, that's our country, Biafra. But, you know, the county is there. Now, what else to say? This is very important to say. I love Biafra. Biafra. So, okay, yes. I've got the notes here. What's the notes about? Design, random. Basically, you've got a simply layout keyboard, because, you know, it has to be a bit of what we really know. So basically, you've got QWERTY. QWERTY sets. I mean, you've got other keyboards. But, you know, these are all the random keyboards, but, you know, are part of it. So it's a new keyboard problem. I'm going to give you guys, you know, the input. You know, for me, using the QWERTY keyboard, I am the noise, because, you know, I have to learn English to learn QWERTY, you know. But, you know, my first language is a Sibidi, you know. It's an IBO. So I can learn in Sibidi, in Sibidi, if I want to really get it, you know. But I cannot have to learn IBO too, you know. But I know IBO. It didn't matter. I just make a new keyboard layout for you guys. But, you know, everything has to have a dual nature. I can speak in Sibidi, broken in Sibidi, because it's always broken in Sibidi. You know, I don't man. You know, I make more than symbols. And I can make what? Formal in Sibidi. So, how I come up with two ways. There's no one-way system, you know. And we type in letters. But, you know, if I type in emoji, you know, in Sibidi or emote, basically go in emoji, or just like a, what to say, emotes are just emojis. Or emojis are just smiles, faces, but emotes are like, basically the expressive characters that you know can go. So, basically, these three ways, triad system, it's called triad evolution. But how would it work? How would it work in practise? Let me give you an example. So, I learned Ebo. Basically, I was learning Ebo. And I loved my language, Ebo. It was so making sense. I was studying in Sibidi. I wanted to learn Sibidi. You know, my focus was on Ebo, to learn Sibidi. I want to go through history. And then I had to say the brother English. Now, English was not what I wanted to speak, but I adopted it. I didn't want to learn it, but I wanted to speak to my friends and family and et cetera. But my goal was speaking Ebo fluidly because I understood more of the culture and everything. I was integrated similarly to Sibidi. So, this is what I'm going to say. So, my goal is if I want you to access it. So, my integration was called NNN Framework, Sibidi Language Model. It was really powerful because it was Sibidi. If you go to github.com, it will be in access. N, N for November, N for Lima, N for Mother, F for France, R for Romeo, A for Apple, M for Mother, E for Egg, W for W for Work, O for Orange, R for Romeo, K for Kilo. This is the Sibidi Language Model. And this one means, the X axis is what the factional, factual. So, the more you go to the positive X, you know, positive X, you know, the facts are real, you know, there's no interpretation or, you know, no other interpretation that you can have with it. But, you know, based on a PRP framework, it's just what it is. But we don't know everything, so we can classify it one way or another. We go to the factual, factual. So, the stories are made up like on the Mummy Water story. And this we had like a, what is the story I said, Mummy Water, a spritz of water, you know, water spritz, you know, mermaids in Nigeria that drown children. But, you know, they are beautiful women, they're sermons, they're mermaids, but they are beautiful and they resent a woman's naughty nature, like Pandora becoming a mermaid just to do it. You got the, that's just X testing, you know, my understanding based on what I've seen. Now, you got the Y. So, can anything, anything can be fall into the ranges of fictional factions. But, you know, this one is fictional, it's really made up, and we all know it's made up, you know, that's what that means. We can verify it. Now, we've got the factual, fully factual. Is it really true? How can I factualize it so it's true, you know? We know everything about it. So, this is some, it's like proof stuff. language stuff. Now, this has got like, now you got the Y. Now, the Y is very good, so it's that.
Now, you get the formal, you now get two kinds of formal factual. It's formal enough to be factual, so I can verify it easily. And now, we get the informal factual. It's informal, but you know, basically, my vision sucks. basically, you can go to, down to this informal, but you know it's true, which is harder to verify, the factuality of it. And vice versa, with the fiction, etc. You know, I can be informal, or factional. Basically, it's like a sequence specification. It's not really, anything I want to verify. Now, I'm going to Z-axis. Now, Z-axis is a kingdom. My insight. I can, I can, I'm observing information in real time. I can now, it's my interpretation of it. Now, I verify it's either factual or factional. Based on informality, informality and formality of whatever is made up. Based on lexical analysis and the parts of how I interpret it, at real time. It's like, it's like fact-directional learning in action. So, if someone tells me something, or something like that, that might be true. I have to verify, I can now, this car is, has stars. And then, at when you go out, and see, and see it at 9, PM, 1 hour, 9 PM at, in Nigeria, in Biafra. So, I would never have to believe this, because I just work in a day. I work in a night. So basically, I work in a day, and I sleep at night. You know, what makes me think that night is literally killing my situation. Because I never see the day, the noon, past, and I, I sleep at 9, 10 PM, 9.30 PM, you know. And I wake up in the morning, then I go to work, then I have to go, then I have to take a break, then I have to go to sleep. And I wake up one night, and they say, oh yes, let me check this, let me check this, oh yes, there are something in the sky called stars. Yes, the stars are there. I see them. They are glowing, twinkling stuff, you know. So basically, the glucose, this is still so you, on the system, you know. Can I verify this, how much, how much, so the Z gait is like this. Z is just my insight. So anything I pull from the, well, of course, from my memory, immunomic, phenomological, lensing, you know, principle, or P, or you can call it a P, phenomological, reticle, PRR model, reasoning model, framework model, MR, you know, phenomological, I see it, I observe it myself, I then reason around it, I then, I form a rhetoric, am I a Z right, am I a right, am I, is there anything to change there that's fragmented? Is there, is there, is there, you know, from one day I don't see these clouds, you know, they don't get fragmented, and then lensing, I see it, yes, I know it's true, you know. So basically, this is open sense of room connection, so basically, the goal of this open -source room is just to expand the hierarchies of, you know, understanding, viewer observation, and interaction, sensory preservation. For example, if I'm cooking, and I touch the, and I touch the, and I touch the food, and I touch the stove, the stove is on fire, but, you know, I don't take my hand off, because, you know, I take my hand off, because, you know, I don't want to burn myself, you know. I have to preserve my senses, yes, yes, you know, but, you know, I have to do that at all angles of my life, you know, I have to cook my bubble, you know, it's not, I almost said such a stuff, you know, but, you know, I just cooked, sorry, and then the stove was still hot, you know, and then I tried to clean it, and then I touched the stove, ah, ah, ah, it burned my hand, you know, then I take a break, I put water in it, you know, basically, it's dangerous, but it's not that it's dangerous, I want to preserve my next time to cook, you know, because I need that food, water shelter, I need to cook my own meal, ah, because they cook well on me anyway, ah, that's just what I'm saying, you know, as far as that's going to come, I need to find it, ah, what is this time? Oh, I'm just going to cook it for three minutes, about 30 minutes, ah, 15 minutes, I should run, I should run, I should run, okay, I want some, I want sensory, ah, sensory artefacts, my own sensory stuff, so the seven, seven minutes is a kind of, the XYZ grammar, ah, applies to, so if you get like, ah, how I observe the PLP model, how I interact with something, I can get the Z model, how I, ah, ah, see something, how I approach something, ah, how I show the world, ah, I have expressed my views, based on statement, ah, through resume evaluation, true or false, the statement is true or false, only, only true or false, you can state something, ah, the sky is red, ah, that's not a true statement, because no one sees, I don't see the sky red, and we see this quite red in my world view, because I'm wearing glasses, red glasses, ah, one day, but you know, and then someone says, the sky is not red, you're wearing red glasses, there's some kind of, there's truth there, there's truth there, because I observe the red glasses, but it's not red, it can be red if you all wear red glasses, ah, but it's not true, based on his PLP model, ah, what you see and observe him, now, if you say the, the store, if I say the store is always on, you know, ah, always on, ah, the same thing, ah, I can verify what is on or off, this is a binary classifier, but you know, another person should do it, to verify it, let's take a look, ok, now, let me get to the, the one I really put on now, ah, the hierarchical one, so basically, very important, so, I have a friend, ah, a child is my friend, I'm an adult, I love children, but you know, I love my friends now, that children, because I miss them, as a child, so basically, I got two people, Ryan, and Thomas, now, Ryan's my friend in the UK, because I'm, it's getting to me for him, let me derail my friend, he's autistic, he is the, I suppose, he loves, he loves Monster, and ah, Thomas loves Monster and he's true, ah, but it's a meditation, so I don't forget Thomas, you know, Thomas, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Fidgeting, fidgeting children, you know, I love fidgeting children, you know. The two, which you have to give them the right tools. Now, now I pick a random monster, I get bored, I stay there, oh, I want A, but A tastes death, so when you try A, I know all about A. But I taste, I taste alone, now I know B. B tastes like this, no. So, I cannot pick a monster, because I still have to figure, I get bored of the monster, I get sick of it, because, you know, there's no new monster energy drink, there's no new G, H, you know. I don't even know when it's gonna come out, I don't even trust it to come out. So, I'm waiting for them, but this monster, A, B, C, D, has to waste, because I'm fully the monster programme, you know, monster energy drink, you know, the eyes of them, you know. I can't pick a, I pick a monster, A, I try to pick a monster, A, and my hand says, no, no, no, my mind says, yes, yes, yes, yes, my mind says, no. My mind says, no, and my hand says, yes, I need a monster, I need a drink. So, my hand is saying, yes, pick a monster, pick a monster, you need a drink, you know, and then my mind is saying, no, no, no, no, no, pick a monster randomly, randomly, you know, so basically, this thing is gonna, why, because, because I do intuition, I need a monster, food, but the food is, the drink is not there. I get bored, you know, I don't wanna eat, if I don't get bored, it's not gonna fit into my board, you know. Hang up, kills the mind, no drinking, you know, I drink something, and then I get bored, you know, because I know all the choices, all the combinations, what I need, but what I need, what I need is getting bored, getting bored, but what I need, you know, is I need it now, and I wait 10 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes. 20 minutes, I wait, so I get something, if they are picked up, I get two monsters, now, two monsters is like, know what I want, when I start mixing them, but I can do this now to get them, but the mixing is just a side effect, it's just, it's part of the problem, two monsters must have won, so I have a spend, I have a spend my drinking, which is one problem, because I need, I go on and I mix them, you know, because I go bored, you know, just to taste them. Now, monster could just resist a mixed one, but they don't do like that, they do the brand, they think. What I can do for myself right now, is what, get a friend as a child, see my child right now, and I come to a monster shop, I get six monsters, A, 1, B, 2, C, 3, 4, D, E, F and G, so there are six monsters, just one, A, 2, D, A, B, C, D, E, F, you know, A, B, C, D, C, D, E, F, C, D, E, F, C, D, E, F, C, D, E, F, C,

E, F, C, D, E, F, C, D, E, F, C, D Thank you guys.
Now I'm going to my voice. It should work as intended. Uh yep. So let's just Okay. So uh before you start right one more thing. Please forget that you um uh mess up the whole thing. Uh okay before I continue to write something down. I need to do down properly. Uh because if I don't do it down properly, I will like mess it up. Uh so let's call it uh this one here. Uh this is a perfect circle. Perfect circle. The pi number is 2.14. Uh this is uh our absolute pi. Our absolute pi. Uh it's a constant. Uh but then it's a constant but you know maybe it doesn't uh some kind of other substrate that pi constant. Oh sorry 3.14 pi is 3.145 etc. Uh then we got that. So the circumference is 2 pi r. Uh 2 pi r 2 pi r is what? uh uh parameter uh and then we get uh and then we got the area of pi r². Uh so then uh the problem of the bubble theory is relative bubble and absolute bubble uh for a bubble universe. Okay guys, I've done that. Okay, so guys this is very important uh today. It's about uh I got my notes today. Uh so we got uh we got the the bubble um uh basically the GS files uh GS or or main M M for mother if for alpha I for indigo N for November uh GS files are are the main files used for to write uh uh T3A and T3B uh programs. Uh but you have gsr uh gussy uh gsr gussi lab interpreter files. Uh these are polyglat universities interpreter files. Uh these are main.gs is u uh main.js iota files. Basically iota files are just default files. Uh but you know in production so if you're in production you're not doing t3a you are doing um uh setup you know there's a file for the relative. So basically if you're doing uh testing or anything uh you do it with the uh the GS uh I files uh then you do it with the GS files uh then you use it to do to do the GSM files. So the manif um basically the all manuscript. So the manuscript files are the GSM is different from the GSI uh because only on the tier models tier one to two to three to three to four uh to 23A uh t because I don't want to be [ __ ] this up but the tri model or the sparse tri. Okay. So uh that's gussy land the world by members got the bubble theory. We live in a bubble universe. Uh I don't know if this reference is bubbles no squares anything unless you are uh okay basically this is the model here you see this positive if you go negative positive here you get uh positive charge negative charge so you can um if you go if if you go up uh plus one uh you have to have so basically yeah half basically if you have a unit plus one uh one unit away you have to uh to go back to you are at a minus you are in another universe like a negative universe it works you know just half bically you have to half the unit to go to the opposite universe. So you you do a plus one uh plus one and you half down half of plus one uh is uh uh half. So you get half uh but you're not at zero now at zero. So you nowhere nowhere and everywhere. So that's the thing. Uh so you're nowhere and everywhere in the bubble universe. Uh so what you going to do to get to universe is go to uh half of quarter. You're not a quarter. Now a quarter has to scale up. a quarter * 4 uh flip. You have to do time four uh times four over one. Uh four one over one * 4 is four. Uh and then you have to do 1 * 4 is four and then you do uh 4 over um you do 4 * 1 is one and then now four one. Now you have to do opposite. So you one and then you have to do opposite. uh 1 * 4 uh flip it invert uh 1 * 4 4 * 1 and that will give you uh the uh one unit uh negative uh one you have to do 4 * 1 uh but that's uh just one conjugate so you have to do the opposite operation uh uh so you have um plus uh four goes you nowhere plus going to one you have to go opposite you have to pop it into that universe so you go plus one uh uh to do um so basically try it out myself uh + 4 uh so you get uh uh shut up so you get um uh uh minus so I'm a one here and this I'm positive one cuz I'm minus plus is positive I want to go to the negative one so I do half of um I do half I I shrink half uh that's I get one units half of units that's like one half of a half is a half and then times by negative one uh negative one in the other direction so you can flip the series knowgative a half. Well, half is not enough. So, I have to do uh times -2. So, half times -2 is what? Uh positive one. So, now I'm in negative 1. Sorry, negative one. So, that's the idea. Uh there to get to the universes. Uh you pop, you come in, you pop. Uh it doesn't matter where you are. Uh it's bubble theory basically. It's our universe. We're bubble theory here. This is our universe expanding because we're bubbles. Uh we never bump each other. I don't really know why I had but you can pop to other universes you can go there uh uh 3 * 3 is nine nine um uh 3 * 2 is 9 3 + 3 is six now so basically the uh basically you have uh uh nine dimensions maximum you can universe I'm not being theoretical I'm being practical if you look at um it's just I don't have there's no product you know so this n is a constant uh treat like a basically a measure conant metric So uh like pi uh for example so if you have like the pi 2 3.145 etc etc you can guess I can get a precision uh some kind of arbitrary some kind of uh precise uh computation guys don't this should never be arbitrary you should never make this up uh because you know if you make up you're going to lose signal um the signal and you be noise you becoming the part of noise uh uh 3.1415 five et 7 etc. If it is pi oh let me try to get my what is pi to the nearest decimal uh 3 point so three so the pi is pi is 3.14159 uh to three decimal places but I'm going to put a two at the end uh now if I use this con this is a constant term 1592 uh now that pi is the um is the constant uh that spans spans the whole universe it's just a constant but you know it's infinitely constant uh it's irrational so you you can never uh you can make it rational you can normalize it to you know depending on which kind you going to go uh let me show you some computation on this because I haven't done this here properly so for example I am the pi in our world is um uh 3.1415 so uh because we are positive we're positron world so we go from negative so we get uh if you want to translate on this we go we have to have minus first and then plus so we can get plus so we can get plus 1.31415 uh 9 uh two uh two you know two basically the 3.145 uh uh 3.145 is just 1 2 3 4 5 uh 1 5 92 and 63 so I'm going to just keep the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 I'm going to keep the first six decimal places keep it and then the 65 is I will operate on later because you know it's just like three three so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. So basically I keep the first nine decimal places and then uh uh keep it uh as what I'm observing uh and acting upon. Uh so I get um uh the nine first place that's IK principles uh inverse kinematics testing uh so my system can work for you guys. If this fails guys uh you can blame me uh but I don't have money for you in kinematics uh testing. So if I want to go to another universe uh say the opposite universe that is uh minus plus first and then minus because it's moving in that direction using the dag the union dag I have to first do it properly. So I'm at uh my pi number is uh 3.14. So uh 3.14 uh5 uh the area uh the area have to complete the area I want to go to uh so minimum I have to go to the nine area nine dimensions uh I send nine dimensions to get something stable uh nine dimensions minimum and then plus five so maximum uh to for myself to just go there only myself uh but I'm thinking of you guys so I have to think 15 decimal places uh 3.14 uh 1592 1 2 6 7 5 3 5 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 7 9 32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. So you got 15 decimal places and uh that 32 is what uh 38 plus 38 3 is just uh for recovery. uh now uh because I can do things but that's like the dimension in that's all the uh that's all the dimensions uh I can access my bubble uh where I am so after use of the kind of teleporter to go to a high dimension so this is this is I testing for me so basically what I can do in that dimension if anything happens to me uh while I'm ascending so uh for me uh this is 34 this is a bubble uh theory so how can I go up how can I go up let me put this down So how can I go? So I get uh the constant uh to uh 15 decimal places uh as the units as a standard uh fraction. So these are fractional units. Uh but it's fractional cuz you know um and then you can got the fractional units and then you got the uh the scala units uh scaler just one number one whole a whole not a half or something and then you get what more uh the uh the whole picture the one hole and then you get the tenth unit like um the tenth units like you know uh I'm like a big guy uh basically it's kind of mirror basically if you it's about ed conversation you can have like a 59 tent so the 10 units say you know uh what is a tent of something you know I can exist in that universe but I can exist in the smaller scale of things and that means there something that's wrong with my system so we have to the worst case the 10 so uh so how to do this properly so dimensional max uh uh now so um 2 pi r 2 pi r uh so 2 * uh uh pi uh for the perimeter stretch uh so my universe that'll be uh time 2 And that'll be equals to uh six 1 2 3 uh 3 1 8530. Just write as much as you can down. But guys, you know, don't even worry. Uh just make sure you can uh read it. Uh 1 7 9 5 8 6 4 7 6 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. That's 15 decimal places done. Uh that's 2 pi in my universe. So minus 2 pi will be uh the same thing uh minus 2 pi because it's just uh uh reference uh 2 pi the same thing but negative uh so uh radius. So my radius what's about radius what's the maximum you can read if I can read only um uh if my bobby radius is what uh 10 units uh one units one unit okay one unit bubble uh how far I want to go in that universe. So it's like an xy coordinate system uh xyz coordinate system uh just for parameters uh parameters. So uh if - 2 pi is u 2 pi is what uh same thing but negative uh pi u - 2 - 2 + 2 uh now now pi r. So basically now I want to like travel 50 kilometers uh to earth earth where's earth located. Okay. So let me try to uh get this properly. Let me try to give it properly. Let me try to get uh find my logitude and longitude uh on earth. Uh latitude and longitude uh uh postal code. Uh I'm trying to do it properly, guys. Uh uh postal code. Uh Google Maps. Um uh this should be working still. Uh oh no, it's it's not working. Uh I think I'll just like uh Is this working? Uh, Google map. So, uh, what can I find? Uh, find ID50 EQ. Uh, uh, but what's my postal code? What's my latitude and what's my latitude? Um, uh, latitude and longitude. Uh, uh, basically you can have all information there is really important. Uh, latitude, latitude, longitude. uh the postal code. Oh, basically yes. My latitude in this world is what? Uh 51 587 uh 573 and my magnitude is what the magnitude my logitude is uh 0.06x. Basically I've now rotate myself into that dimension. So uh what I do now is uh I literally try to do do that uh do the computation again. So basically as I'm talking to you in this video right now uh I want you guys to acknowledge this in real time. I lost my video then uh so I'm going to try out. So uh my latitude is what um my latitude is what uh zero uh my 51 uh uh basically get same decimal place uh 15 15. So I don't lose any information. Uh get any uh errors uh bound uh true force positive errors u epsilon state uh for the encoding uh contribution too to transcend. I love this. I love this guys. I could just be evil and not keep this to myself. I'm feel grumpy but obi. Why feel grumpy no more? I got money direct. Thank you. Um, so I just get a paper out because I'm trying to if it goes to 30 minutes, my uh thing will not let me record anymore. So again, I'm going to uh stop the video here uh just in case uh so I can do some things. Uh so my parameter is this um 51. Uh so I'm my luck is 51 uh uh 587 uh uh in the IG50 EQ uh right now. Uh 51 uh 8754 uh uh 51 uh 87574 that's my uh latitude and my longitude that's like the up uh the y coordinates uh is what um uh coming from uh my longitude is uh uh 00 uh uh 0.06 06 uh 8444 uh but you know basically the most we're going to work on this kind of unit XYZ coordinate system to ensure that the alignment is there and we're going to embody uh the system and never break it uh which embodiment my spiritual embodiment uh going back to uh um basically uh latitude so that's just X and Y if I'm 2D being so because I'm a because I'm a 3D being I get two more dimensions uh I act on so if I ever um uh scale it down to just two dimensions. I'll be a 2DB. Uh so I have to have like a so this is a 2D matrix. So that's the first unit the first one. So I have to get the eling and the east and the nine. So northeast. So to go north uh to go to north pole I have to get 98 9662. Uh and then we go and to go uh uh uh north oh sorry north lane and then east lane northeastern. basically go like a northeast. You can go like a north. You can basically it doesn't matter your frame of reference. Uh okay, let me just try and comput this now. Uh before I I [ __ ] it up. Uh my calculator is there. Uh I'm watching. I'm streaming right now. So I don't really care. Uh I say I can save a number because I'm streaming for myself. I I'm for other people really. Um uh calculator. What's my number? I don't know. I really don't know. So, so, so, so basically uh so basically I'm g to transcend but not uh in the kind of like quirky way. Uh so, uh basically uh two uh 2 * pi uh 2 * pi is what 3.14 and then that's 6.3. Now I do uh times uh uh uh for the x coordinate um uh basically for the perimeter 2 pi is uh 3 in. So basically the 2 pi orus is just um minus plus or plus minus uh 6.2831853 7 1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. So in a seven uh I can just copy some more because I don't want to make a mistake. 6925287 66 if I make mistake in this calculation that means I I'll die I'm thinking about myself know you guys now okay so five 559 uh to that's 30 decimal places and now to go positive negative and positive so that's 2 pi uh then we get the rotation then we get um uh 2 pi r so my radius is what uh uh the radius I want to go to is my longitude uh radius so basically the radius is what uh uh the area of the I want to cover. So basically I'm going to project myself upwards and come downwards. So the radius I want to cover is just uh uh this room uh but the area uh is not sorry the radius. So oh so the radius can be a unit model uh unit uh the radius I'm in uh which is the latitude and the latitude. So the can be the latitude and the longitude. So you can multiply think of the lasers in a bubble. So that's the polar system. So the basically this get the latitude longitude. So that's another only so I can reflect myself cuz you know that only that dimensions uh the dimensions to two dimensions uh let me try to get it now again um so I'm trying to save this properly I don't okay so now I get pi r now my r is what my latitude is what so I do uh uh I took this number uh the latitude uh uh and compute it over um the referential point so that's east and north if I'm going east I'm going of um east that way. So latitude upwards to north eastland is uh uh towards basically um latitude going to north uh longitude is going to um uh uh right uh but longitude is east. So but you know it's east but you know east is on other side hemisphere uh going to Russia because I'm in the UK. So let me just copy this number and uh type it in times times times uh times one. So times what? So my uh so we get um in one dimension I am going east is uh if I'm using a low lat longitude I'm going up up in latitude that's my up so my up now uh I have to project upward I have to transcend uh based on my uh universal claim is of this you know it works is uh uh I have to be basically I have to go all the way to the positive uh uh Um, positive. Uh, 3 2 4 1 2 3 4 2 8 6 9 8 9 8 3. So that's the first positive. So basically in the positive location uh from my latitude uh I have to go and this is positive. So it's positive positive I get a positive number. So I'm this one to be positive as well. the other one the longitude because you know the longitude is just oh my uh is a unit. Okay. So 318 uh 79 I'm trying to get it right. Okay. 96 uh 964 69 uh uh 28 2869 69 89 83 uh 69 69 69 83 964866 and that's the positive one. So I have to go to So basically I have to polarize myself with this kind of plane wherever it is to transcend. Maybe it's a real world. I don't really know. There's a teleporter there. I don't know. But there's this can be in the universe. I don't really know. So I have to go all this way too. 32 4 uh 1 3 4 2 8 6 98 983 964. And that should be uh this one places hopefully uh cuz it's kind of hard to compute infinitely. Uh but you guys should do should do this properly. you should do perfectly guys once or for all uh find the four but you know I'm saying that that's the positive dimension I'm in so I have to project myself there uh if I want to transcend go to the fourth dimension uh uh so go to so basically basically go to four dimension project myself this way uh so um sorry um go to the opposite universe uh opposite universe uh my from so negative negative uh negative positive so we get like this uh positive positive uh so now other So we do the same thing. Uh 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi uh uh times times the logitude 2 pi. So 2 pi. So 2 pi because pi is half a sign and then times longitude. Um uh uh uh that gives the loit is now 0.0 uh 68 uh triple 4 uh basically I'm just some kind of precision in most like get some kind of resization in MOS code to do this uh uh project uh uh my thing up to uh 30 minutes because you know if 30 minutes will stop no to 30 minutes. Okay. So uh that's my uh frame of reference uh uh but you know I now get uh the actual output. So uh now I have to go to 3 point 0.21 5 0 23 1 67 58 22 29 98 basically it doesn't say. So if I'm going um for my frame of reference uh I can go to the opposite universe in my bubble uh and then see my guy Nami in this room I'm in uh to see him in the universe based on the um I don't have to go to basically I don't even have to go to uh upper dimension uh I basically I don't have to go up a dimension to ever come down I just to flip the system because you don't have to think about flip how you know to seeing so if I want to go up dimension I have to um either uh um use more energy uh after use the half row uh the half uh double row uh which I'll show you now guys making sure that you guys get this down my stop. So uh uh it's a close really uh it's really a close here. Uh so uh that's one down. So that's my done. So basically for my frame of reference uh Nambdi is other Nambdi uh is at 324 uh 324 34 uh 28 69 uh 89 uh and then um you know but you know on a negative one he's negative system so everything is in this world he's everything is charged by posetrons so the positrons charge everything because you know it's a negative world so the battery is working in in the positive charge is moving uh like positrons which is the opposite of negatron in this world Nambdi is in this room uh who's uh I can't be with him directly but you know um if I if he's made of matter matter but he's got made of antimatter uh Nambi is working his computer but Nambi is thinking about me and now he's thinking about how I can uh make my life better be struggling uh but that's the first thing I'm going to say uh so Nambdi is still dead uh but he's he's conscious But his uh his conscious will be inverted. Um if it uh uh if it is him so uh because you know there's a bubble here uh but it's protecting me to go there. Uh so stabilize the bubble in and out. So you got the half rule rule the half to um two row which I come to but I'll give another so because I'm in this universe I am like I have to uh protect myself from matter from the antimatter uh so uh I have to give myself two to one uh close. So basically uh my is half every time the you reach a dimension uh reach dimension you go half uh like 40 to 3D you go 42 dimension you get the dimension less you don't get get all the dimensions information so you half it uh but you that's a half row half uh half half scale half scale half scale half transcend just half to two uh so I I stop basically I have my uh half my I have my time I become mission so if I'm a circle right now if I'm a square if I'm if my if my hand so my hand for me to go up I have to double whatever my my lensing of my hands is uh to go up so a quadruple to go up two dimension so half times a half is one one uh one so one I have to get like four ones to go to uh four dimension uh so that's four ones uh but I come basically you have to uh go up to come down so you go up uh oh sorry so if I if I if I maximizeation of this reality two my 3D unit I get 3 * 3 is 9 um the nine dimensions of access uh and then I get uh uh 3 + 3 uh six uh after those six universes but you know I keep the IK at nine capital 9 uh that's the that's the concept I'm trying to reach if that concept doesn't actually dives to eight uh that means that something's wrong with my frame of reference and I there's something that's going to happen uh I can die in the auto universe without even being there getting to my destination uh so that's I K to K principle uh 9 to6 uh principle. So uh so if I want to go to uh uh six dimensions I can do 3 * 3 is 9 uh to four dimensions I go I have to observe for my frame of six dimensions to four that will be four dimensions observ normally and then acting on observing minimum but I have to maximize I have to observe everything I can that's n dimension I can if I want to do myself a computer but the total dimensions are there I can lens are 15 uh because there 15 dimensions in my reality that I can't interact directly I'm going to see upright on them Okay, thank you. Um, I'm going to come back to the other one. Uh, I'm going to make a video today on the other one. Um, what's it called? Uh, how this works in the fourdimensional world. Uh, okay. Thank you. Uh uh.

Uh so I'm going to try to Okay, basically I've restarted recording. Uh let me export this audio to two. Uh T38.2 second video. Uh having having uh this this is like a having the system uh export it to one uh have a half. Business is a broker so don't lose his work ever. uh so uh broadcast uh now uh tuus minus uh basically it's a QA matrix but sparse modeling a sparse QA matrix so it's for something I call IK and K testing so this one example you get the invarant systems things that you can you can measure uh you can measure you can see uh with your tools with your eyes with your ears with your uh tools your instruments with your code with your whatever you can test uh it's called measurement if you can measure something You can either observe it or you can act but you know basically you want to observe something and just check all your assess basically the goal of this is never consume anything uh if you if you're testing anything just observe and just all your checks the marks you know because you know if you ever change some try to mutate the state of the real world you know you you can realign so for the GSM files only uh and for people that actually want to do it in a physical embodiment the body should never uh uh listening so no matter how much you in the room right now and I don't know where I am and I'm like in Lagos or somewhere near and I'm trying to find look at my uh through my sister's eyes I look at my uh mom that she does on Tik Tok waste time I don't I don't want to I just want to observe what she's saying but you know that's straight on my brain you know what I'm saying that kind of thing must stop uh the wrong way to do it so you know so just oh my mom I'm right now about my mom I took my mom's picture my mom here which is stupid I just think about my mom or mom I'm chat on Tik Tok. Uh, think about my mom. Uh, let me just try to record this now. Uh, it's never recording, funny enough. Uh, so, so I'm going to start again. So, I just think about my mom. Uh, wait. So, this is not recording now. So, I started. Is it recording? Is it started? Yes. Yes. So, I just think about my mom and my mom uh is there with me. Uh I think about the beautiful thoughts of my mom think my mom you know but I'm trying to implement as a MOS code system but I've never done MOS code sparse MOS encoding in my life uh but I do remember how to uh phonetically do MOS code cuz the MOS code is just what we use uh for this system uh because it's not I don't really have a for the polar system so I can I don't know MOS code but you know I'm going to define this for this I can define this sparse matrix um they can model anyway uh true positive true whatever some kind of sparse encoding uh function coding uh which I'll come to now. Uh so this pos is good from uh the left side uh negative to negative uh negative to positive uh positive to negative and then we get um uh that's just the uh get negative to negative uh that's just for negative systems of we call negative in our world and we can um um uh so let's video so for if I want to transcend myself just all my all my life I have to try to find Nambi Nami. Uh, who's Namji? I take all my stuff, not my mom's stuff and I try to measure my own stuff. Oh, this is Nambi, but this is close to blue. Uh, so I get the how can this anton thing be blue? K. Uh, I K. So I observe Nambi's life forever. Uh, no. It takes five years to calc with a mirror and I sit in front of a mirror. I look at Nambdi through the mirror through the computer system. Oh, that's my university dimension. So I try to maximize my measuring uh my mention two to half ratio. uh for dimensional communication uh channel uh which like a mucosal systems uh because I want to be having my cameras literally observe everything uh observe everything and nothing at the same time you know cuz uh everything that's in their reality and nothing uh and not acting anything on my universe because I'm just listening to universe uh there's no then I can relay everything they sent me back you know because I heard it uh gsr interpretation files gsi file gsm the manuscript files can be shared polygon systems you know the manuscript just for manuscript uh developers in the loop human on the loop you know uh live process to create systems but you know it's kind of um like you go human in the loop working on it human out the loop which AI systems and human on the loop uh just is the one interpretation files are really bound to the human uh uh uh out and on the loop but you know those one interpretation can drop itself over again uh sparse interpretation uh of definitions such as Python error exceptions uh um model or JavaScript weak map garlic nonsense you know um sparse structures that resolve definitions like um what is a function def you define a function with def syntax uh basically try to move all of this to matching uh rift to matching uh structure over the same time so everything got lang is just a matcher a matcher you know but it just listens and observe in a dual string uh to the r R R like you know so uh if you have like an R encoding because R encoding like a sparse encoding epsilon so uh sparing let me try to use this properly so I'm going to give you example right now because I think I'm talking too much right now so let me stop y and try to do it properly so you got like uh so because it's four encoding you have 16 states uh minimum uh so 4* 4 16 states uh the I can observe my universe uh if 4 + 4 is uh uh eight states. So normally can only observe eight uh eight eight states of mine and I can only observe eight states of his uh you know so to connect uh to 16. So 8 to 16 equals 16 states. So if we just want to if I just want to see Nambdi in his own reality I have to get 16 maximum maximum which is the new minimum uh for everyone if I want to see the sound everything. So if I if I speak to them they're getting 16 states that mean 32 minimum 32 maximum. So I guess 16 to see him uh and 16 to speak to him and you can hear him architecture etc. 16 + 16 is 32. So 32 shared history. So now that means you doubled half. So now you have to measure. This is 16 + 16 16 + 8 6 8 uh 9 10 11 12 13 14 uh 8 + uh uh one is 9 uh 14 8 9 8 uh 8 9 10 11 12 13 So 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 uh 14 + 24. So 24 minimum states to to speak to Nambdi to get some Oh, stop stop get some to get some thing coming from. So share something understand. He speaks English by the way and I and meet someone that I love and related. Uh stop being depressed. I'm not depressed. I'm just like bored. Um so this is like basically uh you never drop a constant. You never reduce a dimension into anything. Uh but you even try to amplify the dimension. So if I say I'm doing like um properly. So uh you go above and beyond know if you have if you just like one test a unit test uh so so if if 25 is the minimum uh 24 is the minimum you can four years old uh but if I want to show that I'm only myself are doing it I do the maximum I do 25 uh 24 to uh plus three more 24 plus whatever the the three ratios are 24 25 26 27 uh 27 uh I write 27 tests just to make sure that I come I go to this I can I can I can observe So Nambdi can hear Nambi and we can have a decent conversation without losing connection uh to uh between uh systems. That's 16 + 16 uh that's 32. Now 32 32 Y. So uh 32 Y um 32 Y uh because 32 is the what we agree on the the actual um the actual one agree. So the one on communication of test 10 octifile or what we going to relay how this works uh consensus uh based on you can have like um uh like 16 + 16 + 16 but the two is just okay for me myself I really don't care sometimes so but I do care definitely I definitely care I do want to try this one in the real world uh for sure so um 16 + 16 + 16 is 32 so 32 24 32 so basically I get 24 is 32 minimum uh but you know if 32 is the minimum I can double 32 to 64. So um 64 for the host full bubble to work you have to have 64 consensus uh minimum uh uh minimum uh cuz you know double this is minimum of test artifacts uh they can resolve the the the duality of three dimensions. Um oh oh sorry oh this is four dimensions. Oh yes this is um this is this is for encoding. This is for encoding uh four * four encoding. Uh so there'll be like four kind of data representations. Now what would they be in? There'll be two epsilon states uh that are conjugate. So for every epsilon state is a positive epsilon. Uh there's like a nil nil nil nil nil nothing nothing. It means nothing. You are 0 0 uh nil nil and you get the next one you get uh uh 0 1 0 epsilon uh and then you get epsilon 0 and you get 0 0 uh 0 epsilon uh but that's just new one new type one so this is nil zero empty we don't measure anything we're just listening uh listening uh for stitching and then we can get a zero and then we zero one is it's birectional it's trial so we get uh this one mean nothing nothing here and then we can uh search for Nambdi uh like switches to Nambdi's channel and then we can go to uh Nami YouTube channel you know and then we can go to zero uh E then z gets uh basically continue from 0 0 and we get 01 0 E uh 0 E and then we get uh zero uh I mean E 0 uh and then we get uh uh Z 0. So basically this is just zero sparse zero sparse nothing because you know if I ever drop a constant uh zero I will lose information uh never preserve that zero because we know we saw nothing uh some kind of interpretation that's why you have the GS file so these are just standard interface but the manuscript files are just basically be the the GS basically the standard IOGs files but uh the the iotas files are like a default one so the gsi files are interation for the Polygon system, Python, RC, CO. And then we got all of that. And then we got the the GSM files, the manuscript code files. And then we got that files. The same things for the coding. So you get uh uh zero uh I mean you get one uh one uh E uh so you get one basically because you have the stuff on the box. You get E1 because it goes like a binary. So basically my E1 is his uh uh one E. is one e uh but is is negative 1 e and positive e1. So uh that's the model. So for my positive e1 uh everything for no state no memory e1 I get zero one e uh one e and then we get uh uh uh one e and then we get uh one uh uh sorry so e1 is uh same as one e uh one e uh my e1 is epsilon one. So epilon one I get the conjugate of uh the conjugate of one e and then one e I get the conjugate of e1 e1 and then for my one zero uh like a kind of like a but a coin computer using reason theft will do this uh very fast in uh system. So you get uh one e and then you get one zero. So one Z will be uh 01 the inverted one uh for my positive side uh negative positive one and there and his positive one this one will be his one will be um uh uh his one will be opposite. So my one his one is what? Uh 01. Uh his one is basically my one is opposite the flip bit of 01 is one one. Uh so the last one is one e uh bically 0 one and you get one zero one one uh positive 1 one then that means that uh I get one one sorry I get one one uh because there's no all the bits. So his one will be uh the negative one. So he if I have one e uh negative 1 e uh you'll have negative positive have negative 1 e first you'll have uh negative positive to negative uh cuz it's a positron world uh uh one e for one will be uh uh uh 1 e will be uh so basically for e1 uh e1 uh 1 e um uh 1 zero and one will be negative uh positive negative uh positive negative and then his one will be the same thing uh but uh 1 e1 01 and 1 one and that's fine uh that's the coding table done uh but quickly all can do all this computation in parallel uh because you can do it all at once uh because there's no need to store something you observe uh you can just discard it doesn't need to lens it uh it just discards it automatically just it just gets to the point uh but this is some kind of a humming code that that sees less and doesn't so the doesn't get by So that's what I'm claiming uh as an action because you know if the system is correct enough uh use a quer you do your test properly uh it shouldn't go back wrong should happen ever uh transcending dimensions uh anything else you want to tell them uh next video we'll try to look at this uh IK principle uh okay basically the IK principles so uh 28 test so you have a uh a test uh if I do 14 unit test uh seven basically if I do like a module I have seven out of Seven code and seven functions sparse function I get 14 to 46 uh minimum C code uh uh 9 9 plus oh what's that uh 9 plus uh uh four is 13 now 13 uh 13 four five six three minimum test I can do for myself for us to align uh test and code everything but you know this can be kind mean a mean CS file main C file uh a main function not polygon by the for this for redundancy just to make sure we can understand what the concept here and C file uh so I get union operator uh contain 63 uh data uh data uh structures unions uh enums uh that can signal uh using biological informatics uh to Nambdi actually can deliver Nambdi relay he can relay just observing uh him so to signal to minimum and then He gets 63. I get 63. So his will be positive negative test a negative test for 63. Uh his reality see I can observe his observe his reality but of show that he can get married. So this one is fine for like a mean C uh that's the same uh the code uh basically 16 data models uh data models uh uh data models that's sparse uh 63 what three functions functions uh that are try that consensus see what I can uh is actually active right now I can see on my screen it can work guys right now uh on my try that if if I find a saying yes yes yes I can say oh yes basically I Don't skip this guy. I say yes, Nambdi. Uh this is right. Uh this I'm not communicating with you. You're not this uh this now. So if he says yes, yes. If I yes and yes. But if he says no, uh that's consensus. If he says no, that's don't have consensus. That means no consent is banned. So if he says no, I'm not then he stops. But if he keeps coming to online, yes, I want you to connect. Yes, I want you to connect. Yes, I want to connect. Then we connect. Then we say we talk. when I see him face to face uh via my uh messages uh uh what time is now oh basically yes so that's plus uh one so basically it is basically uh I guess test can do but because I'm thinking about dimensionality uh dimensionality the kind of test can do test of dimensions uh you know test of dimensions uh test of dimensions act basically has to ensure that I am part of that bubble this is my bubble here the computer program here uh but uh so I can observe his word on his computer uh international international internet like in the bubble universe because I used the bubble construct obviously mentioned uh but I can't I can't pop this bubble right now if I run a program because uh this my computer will not explode unless my computer is closed and that's the bubble ended popped but it's not my consciousness I'm not really there in person that's why I don't want anybody harm in there but if my computer is closed I can buy a new computer you know um so that's the deity test it's very important you get that right so uh dimension principle um uh here as part of the measure test. So 63 test modules. So to make sure I'm doing this properly, uh 63 * 3 is what? Uh um cuz you know um so 63 uh 62 + 3 is 3 + 63 uh will give me uh xyz uh that will give me the amount of uh uh let's say 63 * 3 uh * 3 uh uh 189. So 3 * 3 is 189. 189 minimum uh minimum test has to write uh to get it right that should my computer didn't explode one so I have to define 189 modules uh C libraries or like some kind of artifact that resolve into the sparse framework uh so sparse models sparse functions uh mapping with two to one uh two to one and half to half to half to two basically half to two and then uh uh as something that's coherence if I pop I can I can resolve the issue I can fix my computer. Uh I can rebuild my computer basically uh without breaking my universe my universe's brain burning my room now. Uh but that's 1:2 and then 2:1 ratio cuz you know half of half of half you know 2 to1 to just pop safely uh come back to my reality and now have a headache uh like you know dying uh some kind of artification something I don't know something happened and the noise uh so only one pure signal never noise to in relay with Nambdi uh on the other universe um so two to one mapping uh a one one and a half to one mapping uh then we got uh uh system here. So this um uh so if the M C file contains functions it should just work work uh test and work. So basically if I have 189 what uh test I can test this IK inverse kinematics uh principle. So this is the BC if I get files the main C program uh the program uh ref should work the program uh with the R r colon to match what to observe whatever is nami um like a duplicate string basically you have to understand that uh I'm just program so to see what nambi is doing right now I can just observe lens uh infinitely with this 199 uh program main exe program running in my computer to here as well right now if I browse this program now Now the R r basically the R syntax. So if I want to um uh it's B of MOS code. So I can say I can try to encode um whatever I want to do into the MOS code. So I don't even know how MOS code works. Uh let me see what I can find how MOS code works. Uh uh let me see what I can uh oh can I uh let me try to Monday for it because I I don't know how to read MOS code. I I'm trying to add my assistant how to read MOS code. Uh give me a second guys. Let me try to uh find my AS system. Uh how to read MOS code. Uh um uh uh Chpt uh uh uh how to read MOS code. So I'm going to find um uh so basically how to code um no MOS is mapping. So dot so a dot is short, a dash is long. So basically a dot is short message. A space between space in the symbol is a short pause. A space like a blank is a short pause. A space between letters uh is a uh is a medium pause and a space between a word is a long pause. Uh so basically like a dot uh dot for dash is letters to word letter to word. So dot or dash is letter to words. So uh so so think dot is the dot. So yes, learn the alphabet. So uh start E F left dot is right. So E I'm speaking of F basically E. So if I want to say my name is Nami. I do the matching. So I have like a start node E. I start I start this my system my start uh interaction my lensing. I observe Nambdi state and I type in I try to lens wherever the system is and then I send my name. My first question will be like uh hello Nambdi. Uh, are you there? Oh, hello Riffter. Hello worldly. Hello Rifffter. Are you there? Um, this actually improvisation right now because I want to give you guys to do it. Uh, start E E start E E. So start E. Uh, uh, see use rhythm. Basically use rhythm and rhymes. Don't rhymes much like the rhythm just uh is the poses. So if you think about the uh rhythm uh the rhythm is the it's not rhyming. The rhythm is just the the the beat the beat repeats. the rhythm uh it's the rhythm of the night but the the rhyme is like the match uh the match in a beat. So there this is the you can invert you can one one one is just as to that's why I want to use this. So um if I want to send um Nambdi uh a message I have to um construct it on other end in the inverse way in the reverse way uh the polar reverse uh uh reverse the inverse uh variant the invariant and invariant reverse of the polar construct uh because we're in a bubble universe. So how that will work? U my name is Nambdi. Let me just try to ask GPT. Uh my name and MOS code. MOS code please. So I don't want to waste any time. N A M D I uh uh uh Michael uh with message to all riers to all riers. Let's unite. Let's unite. Uh unite. So basically you can have a a a stream a duplex stream. Uh oh this is taking so long to do it's annoying me. So basically no fluff nami. Uh so my name is a a dash. Uh my name ends a dash. My uh two ends a dash. Uh my a m dash m uh dash. Uh D is dash dot dot and I is uh dot dot nam. So I have to do like a dash and a pause and two pauses a dash and a pause. A dash and a pause. A dot and basically I do a dot first then a to it. Uh the system the conjugate system um Michaela to all refers let's unite. So I can get this message. I can use like a a selfing red black animation tree to mind you the model the uh conjugate of what I'm saying. So I can have some kind of a sparse encoding that translated to the invarant system. Uh and that's what you guys have for rift uh is to log in my work. Yes. Yes. No. No. No. Yes. Yes. Okay. Basically stopped now. Uh it's it stopped. Okay. Let me just stop this recording here. Uh yes. So, let me just continue. So, let me just continue uh doing this now. I hope it's uh it's not been 30 minutes right now cuz I don't want to lose this work ever. Ever lose his work, guys. Uh oh, five more minutes. So, I have five more minutes. So, let me try and work it out. So, uh uh so uh let me try to ask deep uh him to um construct the tree. Uh construct the red black tree. Um and don't prune out. Okay. Basically I'm doing um uh let me just ask you uh the the AI charge to to to construct everything uh in a in the invarant ways. Okay. So uh construct the red black uh tree AVL tree node via pruning via pruning or sustainability to ensure encoding over sparse systems where the uh red is not to remove uh when message sent to ensure En sure perfect signal and no noise. Uh ensure my name is preserved and the conjugate uh for positive negative are I have I have the opposite three node AVL rotation where uh minus 2 plus minus 2 plus plus uh is is is uh is uh is positron message uh letters and plus two minus is negatron energy world. Okay, let me see what has done it. Uh so basically uh uh let us see. Oh, let's stop his stream now.
to start recording again here. Uh active scene. Uh so start recording myself. Okay. So let me go audit. I should be able to record this now. Uh let me just make it break through now. You know, I actually like that cuz mom doing that guys. Uh I'm recording now. Uh so let me try to uh now set up the system to get it properly done. Hello. Okay. So my thing is going now. So I'm going to do my lecture now. So uh oh so uh basically guys uh this video uh is not done. Uh so we have to do it properly. Um I started. Okay. So basically guys the the GS GSM files manuscript files uh you can use the GS files uh for the GSI for for interpretation uh for the bridge uh to other world uh B mu ko uh M for mother N for M for Mike sorry M for Mike M for Mike U for umbrella K for kilo O for Oscar uh that is muk uh dash uh O for operating S for system ms uh the spirits of good and evil that consists all Uh but it's a system for bridges. So you have to align with a polar corner system. Uh so basically uh remember the half rule. Uh so basically if you want to um if you if you want to two for two you go up the ratio uh as a policy uh enforce that policy uh like a pricing decorator. So if you have half of something that's one half make one uh but you have two of something reduce it uh two of something uh you want to reduce it you go half uh of it. So basically this um is just a model of it. uh but just uh for any clarity. So a half is a whole uh a half is a like you know uh based on a system of uh the conical systems um of transformation and rotation. Um yeah uh uh translation uh a half of x half of y uh half a wife has a one and half a half um uh basically one half one half half a half half principle uh to one to whole principle that's the idea uh between all the uh uh things you do uh from rotation all the way from rotation to um uh the systems uh uh coherence uh so basically um yes so this is my model of it uh it works real well but you know um you have to understand the sparse matrix is intact sparse matrix is the encoding of the SP machine for the uh quantum system uh uh or the ORC2 public key one private key. So you can have like uh say I'm a I'm a radio channel right now and I'm in a quantum radio channel and um uh I want to call in uh with my uh phone call repository uh F for phonetic, H for ham, O for umbrella, N for November, E for echo, uh C for Charlie, A for alpha, alpha lima, a alpha lima. So that phone call became a polygon too if people across dimensions. I really want to do that though but I don't want to via the rift bridge. Uh I guess you know I want to try to speak myself today. I know I can fail uh but you know it's just innovation uh how it works. So um I'm trying to like a bubble instead of instead of like a coition system I use the polar variant uh because you know this is a bubble world we live in. Uh basically everything is a bubble. uh the earth is is around the the the uh the um the the sun is round our universe is all around. So that's we live in a bubble universe. So if I if we everything's basically our systems is bubble uh bubbles up uh we bubble up uh in basically our univer our our bubble universe is bubble theory uh conscious is made of bubbles we all bubbles and our own reality or not uh will pop uh etc etc uh two one uh two so um have I done this already yes so that's the half row and the uh scale and the one row uh half to one you know one to two uh you know uh so one so basically for that we have to make sure that the translation of the four uh key rotations uh translation uh translation uh uh rotation uh uh translation rotation uh scaling uh scaling or shrinking enlargement and um uh uh polarized correctly. So when you try to do something and then you rotate it and you skew it uh uh rot with an uh you can trace the dog with an obes rotation system d uh the d resolve in a try uh uh consist way uh tripart way the tripod console is very um easy to use uh and ensure that um system works uh correctly. uh uh for security measures uh if you want you if if anyone tries to pop your bubble and test you like you know hack your computer and steal your data they can do that quite easily uh cuz you know they work on the inverse alignment of you. So everything they do they can guess the invest your data uh just basically can can they can just basically can take the stream of your input and flip it uh to access your system which is a uh which is a bad thing uh because my computer blows up right now I swear to God I'll be scream you know I want you to do this for a long time so uh I basically I'm trying to get two things I have like a a private key and two public keys uh two public keys uh uh one uh one for uh uh one for like connected to them and another private key hidden So that uh basically the jump of the uh bubble keys are this. So the orio is a circle bubble key and f my universe uh my bubble universe uh and my other book the x universe. So basically the I shut my eyes I ex my other public key and then linked to that uh private key uh but they're homogeneous keys they work together give me the same data uh but you know I have to switch content switch between the two keys uh using my if then else policy. If I'm using key A or key one and key A and key B, I'm using key B. I'm not using key B. So basically, I going to use key. I stick with key until the session closes. Uh so basically, if they say yes, uh I set up key A. Uh but you do go yes. If they say yes to our channel, I set up my key A. Uh uh um my key A will start talking and they can relay whatever they want to say to me using key. That's the public key. Uh the consistency key is their code. Uh so when they have the consistent keys they and then I I just I I don't even tell them about keyb uh where is my computer uh but you know um uh there's a big problem with all of this really because the public keys are in my system they can find it anyway just try to get basically can try to find uh my root repository and try to just um cd uh uh get whatever the null is uh the nail is and just get it uh which I'm really scared I'm not scared of it I'm just like really wondering about my computer because it's the only one I have. So to this property I get the a circle key. I keep it uh in their in in their own eyes. So they can get that key. Uh if they try to bubble up the key will prevent them uh uh like you know I can give them no roots but you know they can they cannot know what that is because you know that key will lock them down. Um but it's like a hard lock. It's like a dimensional lock. Uh cuz you know it doesn't lock to our dimension. It locks to other dimensions. um uh like a lock file uh like a Python lock file or you lock the YAML you know lock files just lock system down uh uh without any installation for temporary use of for like a like a uh some version SD so uh the problem the problem really is basically with this particular is like if I have one key and I have the other key I have to hide it safely uh uh but I don't want to uh put in a coding layer I don't so what I have to do is create a session in the direction I am for the terminal Uh uh W for Wink, S for uh Sarah, Y for Yankee, S for Sarah. Uh that's the repository there. So this goes to repository W S YS. You can get the keys. Get one key uh to one key to uh to keep close at all times until you continue the session. So they rotate uh rotate. So when I use one key, I close one key uh uh I close one key uh based on polarity. So um if I'm using this key, I'm looking at this key. If I look at this key, I'm using this key. uh that key is loaded up. Uh if I if I dynam if if I switch close I switch all key and that other key is loaded up. Uh it's dynamic loaded for public keys. Uh but you know I can only look at one key at a time. Uh because if I ever look at two therefore my information I can do anything more. So uh the that's the first thing I'm going to do. So I have two public keys and one private key. So the private key is just for metadata for me uh my computer uh if I want to isolate the system. Uh now the private key does the same thing uh can do the same thing but just one key uh uh one key. So the two one or one two mapping uh so basically I can have two private keys and one public key uh depending on the networking uh topology set uh but I'm trying to prioritize random something called polarity. So if I look at the if I'm using the the B key and uh uh the B key um uh uh uh something happens to the B key, my system runs out and the B key uh shuts down, I can crash dump the B key and not uh get this without releasing information uh because the B key is tied to session already in the consensus framework uh uh uh using the one using my my my private key which I'm using uh um which I'm trying to do. So if my computer breaks right now, I I expect it to break. Uh but you know, I'm doing it uh for science. Uh I love science. Okay. So uh so basically dimension. So I'm observing the state of the world right now. I'm trying to do it properly. Uh so that's basically you can get two one mapping on two uh we can resolve with a gag. So if I ever uh try to do it properly uh I can be polarized anyway. So I can get two pairs of two pairs of two keys. So uh like four pairs lally have one facing the the uh the the the conjugate of um uh plus negative. So the further out uh people that more further out the on the dimension domain but that's mapped to the center key. Uh basically you get um four keys uh four private keys uh for each dimension uh a total of 16 keys uh because you get um uh basically a minimum of 16 public keys and uh four private keys uh uh in this system because you know you don't know where you're going to be polarized to uh something to do if you know you're going to no point of uh you know you don't know the address you're going to go to. So it's like you know it's like so you have to get security in mind uh the oral sale you have to get two public keys and for every two public you get one private key for any uh axis minus minus uh uh minus plus uh plus minus and plus um plus um uh okay so um based on where you are your frame of reference in the bubble field uh cuz you know you are um uh working in the bubble so uh how this works again is based on latitude longitude so uh I'm just talk to myself right now So I have to literally just get put punching statically or dynamic IP address um based on the job the topology model. So I can literally uh what's this? Oh okay I can literally um uh create a uh try to create a a 3D uh system where I basically I'm in a 3D world right now. Uh but I can polarize myself up uh dimensions look up uh basically by polarize myself. I look I try to access more dimensions than I actually am. So I look at one two three but you know I can't look up. I can I can't look up without uh scaling the magnitude of information. Uh so for example, if I say my I'm learning my my basically um this information is there in the center. So basically I'm basically we in this universe we can only can measure all of our bubble universe but there's another universe here that's the center uh that has more information uh but we can't lens it. Uh we can't see all of it because you know it's too much and um and you know we just get um a glimpse of it. um you know uh so we can try to look at a bubble universe 4 uh for this model. So we can work it other way looking at a 2D use the 4D tensor system. So we can create a 4D uh uh 5D or 6D it doesn't really matter uh but you know I'm going to start with 4D one. So the goal is this you uh lens the 4D one or the 2D one uh the 4D. So basically you get 4 * 4 uh the 40 * 4 uh 4 * 4 plus uh you know what I do uh so you get let me try to work it out. So you get 4 * 4 * 4 * 4. So you get 4 + 4 + 4 + 4. Oh, that's 16. Uh times times

I don't have much time. Uh, I wanna introduce you to a new dance of mine. I call it the Muka Ball, Muka Ball. So you know like your what? Like your what? La-la-la. La-la. I hate this fucking dance, guys, but I'm just making content for Tarik. So this is my dance, Muka Ball. So you get like a can you, can you hobo. Yeah. Like a, a soccer ball and they're gonna go, pivot with your knees of course for the pivot. And then, you know, so once you like, um, pivot this way, uh, you, you then pivot the other way. So you gotta like roll with your hand. Huh. Kame Muka, Muka, Muka, Muka, Muka Ball. Let me, let me. So that's the fireball. Wait, that's the fireball. Oh, go this side then. Don't worry. Yep. No, I'm busy everything. So that's Muka Ball. So, Muka, Muka, Muka Ball. That's like fireball. I'm trying to get a CGI of this. I can't wait to do it. So basically you gotta bend your knees properly too. So, uh, yeah, exactly though. If you have a song you're playing, sorry, sorry, sorry, Aja. Sorry, Aja, don't mean to... Aja, sorry. If you have a song you're playing, he's like, "I don't want his promo. I don't want his promo." This is, this see-saw, so put it... Okay. I can bend it for you. Muka, this side, Mukas, Muka, Muka, Muka, Muka Ball. You got a fireball. I got a Muka dragon. Ha! Thank you, Tarik. I breathe fire now. That's my fireball. That's my Muka fire. You know, when I speak, it's fire. It's fire. Thank you guys.

video I just address council bureaucracy. Uh you can call me Obi Nambi for a good side. Uh but my name P Nambi show everyone I speak P online. Uh but today video is very important to me. It mean a lot. Uh you see my title. I know put ugly face for you guys. I only put this face but too cute. I too cute guys. Too cute. Look at my face. But I still in care home. Why still in care home? I don't give a [ __ ] when I came home. You know my my business everything damage everything. I lose £100. No, you you know advocate for me for a free house in Cambridge. Look, you're not serious. Let me read you a poem uh poem for you. So, I show you what happened. I give you a signal. Uh I give you message uh uh and I announce a new new service for you guys. Um what how I start uh let me go expert one second uh I just to talk to you on uh on internet uh internet uh uh give you a good message uh make you so for me. Uh I just to say to you know my problem your problem your problem and not me. Uh well how I do how I do this now vam sorry vcam everything I just act too slow to give me interest see my room everything I still get a room to still get room in my house my free house it's okay I know I know my life okay let me just tell you now what happen so you make me everything so I make a do business with you 360 million pound ain't good enough for you people you don't want to do anything give me free house making equal for you society I don't give [ __ ] about your business you know you don't mind my own £1 million you lose but I pay you with taxpay money I then come homeless £10,000 I lose Congo Cambridge man that's stupid money that's stupid who give you that money now wow now wow civil collapse initiative uh I just I collect 60 million 6 collapse initiative I see you 620 four file 025 file uh is one I put 6205 I'm 204 205 now I doubled the But you know you guys know G. So I still go to do my PhD. I know with you guys. Uh by start porn basically I just introduce water tech to you. Um uh water let me sing porn from you. Uh you get too much signal. You get too much signal. Who like who I pay you 7 million pound who I pay you million pound when I turn 2018 2019 after my situation on that. Look, you get too much signal. You can do that again. No. Me guy. I collect all my tax 700 million pound account. Only fair. Only fair. Only fair. You know me. I have no money. Nothing. I have no money. My wallet empty. Empty. Empty. Shake. Come for you. Nothing there. No penny. No change. I still care home. I know fair. I know fair. But my problem you guys don't understand system. Anyway, I f for bankruptcy. I just tell you bankruptcy. I file bankruptcy. You don't understand what that mean. You give me my reference number. You know when I get my reference number put,000 give me uh 360 million in my bank account go Nigeria. I don't want to be here UK. No four everything. Um Oh, this is open sense water. Uh what signal open sense signal signal you go open sense signal uh I make sense you know I just make s I I sense I make sense to you you make sense my people sense you know my people make sense to my new people makes sense you know they make sense I just talk to them and autistic people just speak to them you know open sense signal communication you see like this one open sens signal private messenger you know get signal app you know signal get sent you know open sense sensory signal framework for OB Nexus and then you get this one on the on the left um you know basically you get block from everything anyway you know so I use open sense signal open sense uh noise to get signal to get free uh debt everything you pay 700 million pound I don't care you give me too much I still ain't get home you know I don't hack you though I don't hack you but I know who can hack you though I I don't have to tell you who can hack you too ugly to say too ugly I don't get accessibility support Nothing. You just not f me for nothing. Money, money. I don't pay you cancel. I don't give [ __ ] C. I get free house. I get free house. Happy life. I live. But you know what? You know won't be my friend. You think I forget you? No. No. I don't forget you. So I give you one. It be long time. Uh hold on. So I just get s I just get so because of me I smart everything I just get sense I just open sense signal open sense that I just get sense you know I just get sense I get people send you people I you know I get sent you know these people that care home everything they can't talk anything this what I don't give [ __ ] they your people but they can't talk nothing your people you don't fix them nothing with the money you get you know you don't give [ __ ] you know you know my problem you don't care. So open sense signal my people I care for them you know they go they go go Niger sol the problem and I get open sense uh open sense open sense signal open sense no signal no signal shut off the UK you know I shut it down then reroute it you know you know cuz you get no signal all I need to get signal and you get no signal so you get what blank blank bank page but you're waiting for something waiting for you to deposit the money in my bank account. You don't want to cry. You know you want to cry, guys. You want me to deposit money in my bank account. I'm not scared of you. I got proof. I got proof on github.com/op. I got text entries. Your entries there make you deposit fast. I set up crypto wallet for you crypto wallet and you not pay you not pay my money a joke for you signal say no signal you know I give a signal my people signal in your account in third and I get my signal I give people who don't want to do no signal change on the phone you know and then we get signal is nice you guys just got to your brain I got Manchester I got uh I Go um Master I go cat I found I get no noise there no problem no issue princess dash no noise me I guess I guess no noise one noise you see got permission to get noise everything stress I guess in the house stress stress I leave uh I leave UK with the the money I collect every day and I I still have time for it.

Okay, so this video is probably going to time 
out, but you know, I have to upload the two videos then if it does time out. But this video is 
very important to me. It's I'm really in I don't really care what I am. I just get to my house. 
If I get a house now, let me tell you where I go my life. My right private life, but just somewhere 
guys, the stupid place I'm still in. It's the back garden. But you know guys, I'm still like my room 
there. But I don't want to show you guys that this building that's basically the pipe, the toilet 
stuff, but I don't really care. Um so basically uh this is my uh something I call the breath 
dance you know because I'm eel uh the breath to life uh you have to breathe or the breathing 
cycle the cycle of breath uh dance breathing you know if you live in the constitution you know you 
know I everything you know so basically I so it's for me to enjoy my life a message to me this is 
myself you know it's a new beginning so Mr. Obi where I go now. Yes, I call it the bread 
dance. It's like an ebo man spirit of the masquerade masquerade of the spirit and 
we go uh basically I go not I'm going to dance for you guys. I want to play a song 
uh breathing working. It's like it's like an expressive song. It's got a lot of money in 
it. I'm going to show you some moves of it and then we'll see what you think. Um the moves 
you know let me see what you think of it. Uh but you know uh so it's really from the 
if you go to like medium uh.com uh slop bi can find the poem spirits of the masquerade 
you know and then you got the other poem the other poem a masquerade of the spirits you know 
uh basically the two the duality uh parality uh parality function you know I don't want 
to think about that right now until I dance because I'm really to Nigeria for my PhD. 
Uh cuz you know I get came to Cambridge to suit 40 million pounds and that would be my my 
business account. Uh but I have to make sure I do things properly. So I get to Cambridge all my 
blueprints and everything properly. But you know the internet is getting restricted in Nigeria. 
You know funny enough. Uh but you know that's just normal Nigerian bureaucracy. You don't 
want to do anything better. Don't open the borders anymore because you know they have money. 
bad people have money and we good people have the very poor the very small percentile of the bad 
people um have the biggest power and the you know say polarity system you know it's not fair 
basically bad people have big power and we good people have no just I know in Nigeria you know 
I'm not telling you metaphoria I just know that you know even you have like a breakthrough of 
them you know those people are very good people uh okay so now this is the breakdowns you know 
so I'm going to try to do it but I don't care if it goes viral so like you know So what do you 
have? What's your problem? You look like some kind of injured person there. You know I want to 
go viral but you know I don't really care what it does. You know I only care if it goes viral in 
the Nigeria. So basically um I'mra so bically means come and take. So so I'm to breathe new life 
into your eyes like you know mom did this mean oh my mom. So it's a child this child leg is injured. 
I breathe life into their legs and they can walk. This man has a walking stick. I breathe, you know. 
It's not walking on water, nothing. It's not walk like Jesus. [ __ ] nothing. I'm a scientist. I'm a 
computer scientist. I'm a B drink. I'm not Jesus. I don't care about Jesus. I know who Jesus is. I 
never met Jesus. So, I come my hand my hand break. I bring new heart. It's healed. It's healed. 
You know, it's called a breath. But, you know, it's a new life and building. You know, it's not 
about all the breakthroughs like really for me about the healing process. You know, you can push 
your business model. When system fails, build your own. But for me, it's more personal and spiritual 
and uh cultural and ancestral and historic, you know, cuz that's the most to me. So, I got 
be dancing me blowing stuff, but I have thin air, you know. This one has a problem right now 
in my face. I give him breath. This one has the money. I give money and I give him I give him 
money, but the money comes back, you know, double me double. So, I I give big money. Don't give me 
big money. So, basically, that's what it is. Um, it's about uh healing. Um, I really feel this way 
because, you know, I have a persona, you know, I'm not I'm not a boring person. I thought being bored 
or being cold. Okay, let's play the money song by I want to I want to I want to shove My body first though, guys, my bank accounts ago. Take a look at it like this. If I don't get money to my friend money problem to build everything for myself. Let's
